,
Ere this he had returned, with fury driven
By his Avenger, since no place like this
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
Wings growing, and Dominion given me large
Beyond this Deep; whatever draws me on,
Or sympathy, or some connatural force
Powerful at greatest distance to unite
With secret amity things of like kind
By secretest conveyance.  Thou my Shade
Inseparable must with me along:
For Death from Sin no power can separate.
But least the difficulty of passing back


Stay his return perhaps over this Gulf
Impassable, Impervious, let us try
Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine
Not unagreeable, to found a path
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World
Where Satan now prevails, a Monument
Of merit high to all the infernal Host,
Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,
Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
By this new felt attraction and instinct.



Whom thus the meagre Shadow answered soon.

 Go whither Fate and inclination
strong
Leads thee, I shall not lag behind, nor err
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
The savour of Death from all things there that live:
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.



So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
Against the day of Battle, to a Field,
Where Armies lie encamped, come flying, lured
With sent of living Carcasses designed
For death, the following day, in bloody fight.
So scented the grim Feature, and upturned
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
Sagacious of his Quarry from so far.
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
Wide Anarchy of Chaos damp and dark
Flew divers, and with Power (their Power was great)
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
Solid or slimy, as in raging Sea

Tossed up and down, together crowded drove
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive
Mountains of Ice, that stop th'imagin'd way
Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich

Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soil
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
As with a Trident smote, and fixed as firm
As Delos floating once; the rest his look
Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move,
And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the 
Gate,
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gathered beach
They fastened, and the Mole immense wrought on
Over the foaming deep high Arched, a Bridge
Of length prodigious joining to the Wall
Immovable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
Smooth, easy, inoffensive down to Hell.
So, if great things to small may be compared,

Xerxes, the Liberty of Greece to yoke,
From Suss his Memnonian Palace high
Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont

Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,
And scourged with many a stroke th'indignant waves.
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
Over the vexed Abyss, following the track
Of Satan, to the self same place where he
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
From out of Chaos to the out side bare
Of this round World: with Pins of Adamant
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
And durable; and now in little space


The confines met of Empyrean Heaven
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposed; three several ways
In sight, to each of these three places led.
And now their way to Earth they had descried,
To Paradise first tending, when behold

Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries
rose:
Disguised he came, but those his Children dear
Their Parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
He after Eve seduced, unminded slunk
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
By Eve, though all unwitting, seconded
Upon her Husband, saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them terrified
He fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
The present, fearing guilty what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned
By Night, and listening where the hapless Pair
Sate in their sad discourse, and various plaint,
Thence gathered his own doom, which understood
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned,
And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't
Met who to meet him came, his Offspring dear.
Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight
Of that stupendous Bridge his joy increased.
Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair
Enchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.





O Parent, these are thy magnificant deeds,  

Thy Trophies, which thou view as not thine own,
Thou art their Author and prime Architect:
For I no sooner in my Heart divined,
My Heart, which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,
That thou on Earth had prospered, which thy looks
Now also evidence, but straight I felt
Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy Son;
Such fatal consequence unites us three:
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,
Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track.
Thou has achieved our liberty, confined
Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow'rd
To fortify thus far, and overlay
With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.
Thine now is all this World, thy virtue hath won
What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gained
With odds what War hath lost, and fully avenged
Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt Monarch reign,
There did not; there let him still Victor sway,
As Battle hath adjudged, from this new World
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,
And henceforth Monarchy with thee divide
Of all things parted by the Empyreal bounds,
His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,
Or try thee now more dangerous to his Throne.



Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answered glad.

 Fair Daughter, and thou Son and
Grandchild both,
High proof ye now have given to be the Race
Of Satan (for I glory in the name,
Antagonist of Heavens Almighty King)


Amply have merited of me, of all
The infernal Empire, that so near Heavens door
Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm
Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent
Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore while I
Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
With these successes, and with them rejoice,
You two this way, among these numerous Orbs
All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth
Dominion exercise and in the Air,
Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declared,
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
My Substitutes I send ye, and Create
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might
Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now
My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
If your joint power prevails, th'affaires of Hell
No detriment need fear, go and be strong.



So saying he dismissed them, they with speed
Their course through thickest Constellations held
Spreading their bane; the blasted Stars looked wan,
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclipse
Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down
The Casey to Hell Gate; on either side
Disported Chaos over built exclaimed,
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,
That scorned his indignation: through the Gate,
Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,
And all about found desolate; for those
Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,

Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
Far to the inland retired, about the walls
Of Pand??monium, City and proud seat
Of Lucifer, so by allusion called,
Of that bright Star to Satan paragond.
There kept their Watch the Legions, while the Grand
In Council sate, solicitous what chance
Might intercept their Emperor sent, so he
Departing gave command, and they observed.
As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe
By Astracan over the Snowy Plains
Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the horns
Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
The Realm of Aladule, in his retreat
To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late
Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
Many a dark League, reduced in careful Watch
Round their Metropolis, and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of Foreign Worlds: he through the midst unmarked,
In show Plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order, past; and from the door
Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible
Ascended his high Throne, which under state
Of richest texture spread, at th'upper end
Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while
He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
And shape Star bright appeared, or brighter, clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,
Their mighty Chief returned: loud was th'acclaime:

Forth rushed in haste the great consulting Peers,
Raised from their Dark Divan, and with 
like joy
Congratulant approached him, who with hand
Silence, and with these words attention won.



Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,
For in possession such, not only of right,
I call ye and declare ye now, returned
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit
Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,
And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,
As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven
Little inferior, by my adventure hard
With peril great achieved.  Long were to tell
What I have don, what suffered, with what pain
Voyaged th'unreal, vast, unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion, over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved
To expedite your glorious march; but I
Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride
Th'untractable Abyss, plunged in the womb
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde,
That jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
My journey strange, with clamorous uproar
Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found
The new created World, which fame in Heaven
Long had foretold, a Fabric wonderful
Of absolute perfection, therein Man
Placed in a Paradise, by our exile
Made happy; Him by fraud I have seduced
From his Creator, and the more to increase
Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat
Offended, worth your laughter, hath given up
Both his beloved Man and all his World,

To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
Without our hazard, labour, or alarm,
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
To rule, as over all he should have ruled.
True is, me also he hath judged, or rather
Me not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape
Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,
Is enmity, which he will put between
Me and Mankind; I am to bruise his heel;
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
A World who would not purchase with a bruise,
Or much more grievous pain ? Ye have th'account
Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,
But up and enter now into full bliss.



So having said, a while he stood, expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear, when contrary he hears
On all sides, from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss, the sound
Of public scorn; he wondered, but not long
Had leisure, wondering at himself now more;
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
His Arms clung to his Ribs, his Legs entwining
Each other, till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
Reluctant, but in vain, a greater power
Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,
According to his doom: he would have spoke,
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue, for now were all transformed
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail,

Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisb??na 
dire,

Cerastes hornd, Hydrus,
and Ellops drier,
And Dipsas (not so thick swarmed once the 
Soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle

Ophiusa) but still greatest he the midst,
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
Ingenderd in the Pythian
