            Paradise Lost. BOOK IX
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Satan having compassed the Earth, with meditated guile
returns as  a mist by Night into Paradise, enters into the
Serpent sleeping. 
Adam and Eve in the Morning go forth to their
labours, which 
Eve proposes to divide in several places, each labouring
apart: 
Adam conscents not, alleging the danger, lest that Enemy,
 of whom they were forewarned, should attempt her found alone:  
Eve loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges 
her going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her 
strength; Adam at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone;
his  subtle aproach, first gazing, then speaking, with much  flattery
extolling Eve above all other Creatures. Eve
wondering to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he atcoined to  human
speech and such understanding not till now; the Serpent  answers, that
by tasting of a certain Tree in the Garden he  attained both to Speech
and Reason, till then void of each;  
Eve requires him  to bring her to that  Tree, and
finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden: The  Serpent now grow
bolder, with many wiles and arguments induces  her at length to eat; she
pleased with the taste deliberates a  while whether to impart thereof to
Adam or not, at last brings  him of the Fruit, relates what
persuaded her to eat thereof: 
Adam at first amazed, but persieving her lost, resolves 
through vehemence of love to perish with her; and extenuating the 
trespass eats also of the Fruit: The Effects thereof in them  both; they
seek to cover their nakedness; then fall to  variance and accusation
of one another.


NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar used
To sit indulgent, and with him partake
Rural repast, permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamed: I now must change
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,
And disobedience: On the part of Heaven
Now alienated, distance and distaste,
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,
That brought into this World a world of woe,
Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
Not less but more Heroic then the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursued
Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd,
Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cytherea's Son;
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deigns


Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
And dictates to me slumbering, or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated Verse:
Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
Pleased me long choosing, and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to entice
Wars, hitherto the only Argument
Heroic deemed, chief maistrie to dissect
With long and tedious havoc fabled Knights
In Battles feigned; the better fortitude
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture, emblazoned Shields,
Impress quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgeous Knights
At Joust and Torneament; then marshalled Feast
Served up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
Not that which justly gives Heroic name
To Person or to Poem.  Me of these
Nor skilled nor studious, higher Argument
Remains, sufficient of it self to raise
That name, unless an age too late, or cold
Climate, or Years damp my intended wing
Depressed, and much they may, if all be mine,
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.


The Sun was sunk, and after him the Star
Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
between Day and Night, and now from end to end
Nights Hemisphere had veiled the Horizon round:
When Satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved
In meditated fraud and malice, bent

On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, fearless returned.
By Night he fled, and at Midnight returned
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descried
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,
The space of seven continued Nights he rode
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
He circled, four times crossed the Carr of Night
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
On the eighth returned, and on the Coast averse
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wrought the change,
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise

Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
In with the River sunk, and with it rose
Satan involved in rising Mist, then sought
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searched and Land
From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole

M??otis, up beyond the River Obe;
Downward as far Antartic; and in length
West from Orontes to the Ocean barred
At Darien, thence to the Land where flows

Ganges and Induce: thus the Orb he roamed
With narrow search; and with inspection deep
Considered every Creature, which of all
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
The Serpent subtlest Beast of all the Field.
Him after long debate, irresolute
Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom

To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight: for in the wily Snake,
Whatever slights none would suspicious mark,
As from his wit and native subtlety
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observed
Doubt might beget of Diabolic power
Active within beyond the sense of brute.
Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured:



O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens
That shine, yet bear their bright officious Lamps,
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,
In thee concentring all their precious beams
Of sacred influence: As God in Heaven
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou
Centring receive from all those Orbs; in thee,
Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth
Of Creatures animate with gradual life
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, al1 summed up in Man.
With what delight could I have walked thee round,
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
Of Hill, and Valley, Rivers, Woods and Plains,
Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forest crowned,
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these
Find place or refuge; and the more I see
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
Of contraries; all good to me becomes
Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.

But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven
To dwell, unless by mastering Heavens Supreme;
Nor hope to be my self less miserable
By what I seek, but others to make such
As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
For only in destroying I find ease
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyed,
Or won to what may work his utter loss,
For whom all this was made, all this will soon
Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe,
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:
To me shall be the glory sole among
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred
What he Almighty styled, six Nights and Days
Continued making, and who knows how long
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps
Not longer then since I in one Night freed
From servitude inglorious well-nigh half
the Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers: he to be avenged,
And to repair his numbers thus impaired,
Whether such virtue spent of old now failed
More Angels to Create, if they at least
Are his Created, or to spite us more,
Determined to advance into our room
A Creature formed of Earth, and him endow,
Exalted from so base original,
With Heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed
He effected; Man he made, and for him built
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,
Him Lord pronounced, and, O indignity!
Subjected to his service Angel wings,
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend
Their earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance

I dread, and to elude, thus wrapped in mist
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and pry
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may find
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazy folds
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
O foul descent! that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained
Into a Beast, and mixed with bestial slime,
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
That to the height of Deity aspired;
But what will not Ambition and Revenge
Descend to? who aspires must down as low
As high he cord, obnoxious first or last
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter ere long back on it self recoils;
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,
Since higher I fall short, on him who next
Provokes my envy, this new Favourite
Of Heaven, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,
Whom us the more to spite his Maker raised
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.



So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Dry,
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
His midnight search, where soonest he might find
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
His head the midst, well stored with subtle wiles:
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
Nor nocent yet, but on the grassy Herb
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
The Devil entered, and his brutal sense,
In heart or head, possessing soon inspired
With act intelligential; but his sleep
Disturbed not, waiting close th'approach of Morn.

Now when as sacred Light began to dawn
In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathed
Their morning incense, when all things that breath,
From th'Earths great Altar send up silent praise
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair
And joint their vocal Worship to the Quire
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
The season, prime for sweetest Scents and Aires:
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Their growing work: for much their work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two Gardening so wide.
And Eve first to her Husband thus began.




Adam, well may we labour still to dress
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour,
Our pleasant task enjoined, but till more hands
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present,
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct
The clasping Ivy where to climb, while I
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixed
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:
For while so near each other thus all day
Our task we choose, what wonder if so near
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits
Our days work brought to little, though begun
Early, and the hour of Supper comes unearned.




To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.

 Sole Eve, Associate sole,
to me beyond
Compare above all living Creatures dear,
Well has thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed
How we might best fulfil the work which here
God hath assigned us, nor of me shalt pass
Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found
In Woman, then to study household good,
And good works in her Husband to promote.
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
Labour, as to debar us when we need
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,
To brute denied, and are of Love the food,
Love not the lowest end of human life.
For not to irksome toil, but to delight
He made us, and delight to Reason joined.
These paths & Bowers doubt not but our joint hands
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield.
For solitude sometimes is best society,
And short retirement urges sweet return.
But other doubt possesses me, least harm
Befall thee severed from me; for thou know
What hath bin warned us, what malicious Foe
Envying our happiness, and of his own
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,
Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each

To other speedy aide might lend at need;
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealty from God, or to disturb
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays,
Who guards her, or with her the worst e
