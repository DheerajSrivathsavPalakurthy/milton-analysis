next upstood

Nisroc, of Principalities the prime;
As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,
Sore toiled, his riven Arms to havoc hewn,
And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.

 Deliverer from new Lords, leader
to free
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
For Gods, and too unequal work we find
Against unequal arms to fight in pain,
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well
Spare out of life perhaps, and not rapine,
But live content, which is the calmest life:
But pain is perfect misery, the worst
Of evils, and excessive, overturns
All patience.  He who therefore can invent
With what more forcible we may offend
Our yet unwonted Enemies, or arm
Our selves with like defence, to me deserves
No less then for deliverance what we owe.



Where to with look composed Satan replied.
 Not uninvented that, which thou aright
Believst so main to our success, I bring;
Which of us who beholds the bright surface
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gems & Gold,

Whose Eye so superficially surveys
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
Of spirituous and fiery spume, till touched
With Heavens ray, and tempered they shoot forth
So beauteous, opening to the ambient light.
These in their dark Nativity the Deep
Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame,
Which into hallow Engines long and round
Thick-rammd, at the other bore with touch of fire
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
From far with thundering noise among our foes
Such implements of mischief as shall dash
To pieces, and overwhelm whatever stands
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawn,
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joint
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.

 He ended, and his words their
drooping chere
Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
Th'invention all admired, and each, how he
To be th'inventer missed, so easy it seemed
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible: yet happily of thy Race
In future days, if Malice should abound,
Some one intent on mischief, or inspired
With devilish machination might devise
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
Forthwith from Council to the work they flew,
None arguing stood, innumerable hands
Were ready, in a moment up they turned


Wide the Celestial soil, and saw beneath
Th'originals of Nature in their crude
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foam
They found, they mingled, and with subtle Art,
Concocted and adusted they reduced
To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this Earth
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
Whereof to found their Engines and their Balls
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night
Secret they finished, and in order set,
With silent circumspection unespied.
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heaven appeared
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
Of Golden Panoply, refulgent Host,
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
Looked round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scour,
Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,
Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
In motion or in alt: him soon they met
Under spread Ensigns moving nigh, in slow
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail

Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
Came flying, and in mid Air aloud thus cried.



Arm, Warriors, Arm for fight, the foe at hand,
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
He comes, and settled in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure: let each
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
Fit well his Helm, gripe fast his orbit Shield,

Born even or high, for this day will pour down,
If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,
But rattling storm of Arrows barbed with fire.

 So warned he them aware
themselves, and soon
In order, quit of all impediment;
Instant without disturb they took Alarm,
And onward move Embattled; when behold
Not distant far with heavy pace the Foe
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
Training his devilish Enginrie, impaled
On every side with shadowing Squadrons Deep,
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
A while, but suddenly at head appeared

Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud.



Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfold;
That all may see who hate us, how we seek
Peace and composure, and with open breast
Stand ready to receive them, if they like
Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
Heaven witness thou anon, while we discharge
Freely our part; ye who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.



So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce,
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
Divided, and to either Flank retired.
Which to our eyes discovered new and strange,
A triple mounted row of Pillars laid
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seemed
Or hollowed bodies made of Oak or Fur
With branches lopped, in Wood or Mountain felled)
Brass, Iron, Stony mould, had not their mouths
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,


Portending hollow truce; at each behind
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
Stood waving tipped with fire; while we suspense,
Collected stood within our thoughts amused,
Not long, for sudden all at once their Reeds
Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,
From those deep throated Engines belched, whose roar
Emboweld with outrageous noise the Air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
Their devilish glut, chained Thunderbolts and Hail
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
That whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;
The sooner for their Arms, unarmed they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove; but now
Foul dissipation followed and forced rout;
Nor served it to relax their serried files.
What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
Repeated, and indecent overthrow
Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
And to their foes a laughter; for in view
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode their second tire
Of Thunder: back defeated to return
They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,
And to his Mates thus in derision ca11'd.



O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
To entertain them fair with open Front

And Breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms
Of composition, strait they changed their minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemed
Somewhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
For joy of offered peace: but I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result.



To whom thus Belial in like gamesom  mood,

 Leader, the terms we sent were
terms of weight,
Of hard contents, and full of force urged home,
Such as we might perceive amused them all,
And stumbled many, who receives them right,
Had need from head to foot well understand;
Not understood, this gift they have besides,
They show us when our foes walk not upright.



So they among themselves in pleasant vein
Stood scoffing, heightened in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of Victory, eternal might
To match with their inventions they presumed
So easy, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
And all his Host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed)
Their Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
Light as the Lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,
From their foundations loosening to and fro
They plucked the seated Hills with all their load,
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggy tops 


Up lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,
Be sure, and terror seized the rebel Host,
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the Mountains upward turned,
Till on those cursed Engines triple-row
They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
Came shadowing, and oppressed whole Legions armed,
Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
The rest in imitation to like Arms
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
So Hills amid the Air encountered Hills
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
Infernal noise; War seemed a civil Game
To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heaven
Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspread,
Had not the almighty Father where he sits
shrined in his Sanctuary of Heaven secure,
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
To honour his Anointed Son avenged
Upon his enemies, and to declare
All power on him transferred: whence to his Son
Th'Assessor
