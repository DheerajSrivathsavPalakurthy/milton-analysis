 with his followers then with him they dealt?



Be sure they will, 
              said th'Angel; but
              from Heaven
He to his own a Comforter will send,
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,
To guide them in all truth, and also arm
With spiritual Armour, able to resist

Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts,
What man can do against them, not afraid,

Though to the death, against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompense,
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors: for the Spirit
Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends
To evangelise the Nations, then on all
Baptised, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
As did their Lord before them.  Thus they win
Great numbers of each Nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: at length
Their Ministry performed, and race well run,
Their doctrine and their story written left,
They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint,
Left only in those written Records pure,
Though not but by the Spirit understood.
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
Places and titles, and with these to join
Secular power, though feigning still to act
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God, promised alike and given
To all Believers; and from that pretence,
Spiritual Laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience; Laws which none shall find
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and bind
His consort Liberty; what, but unbuild

His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
Their own Faith not another: for on Earth
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume:
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part,
Will deem in outward Rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of Faith
Rarely be found: so shall the World go on,
To good malignant, to bad men benign,
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just,
And vengeance to the wicked, at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Women's seed, obscurely then foretold,
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
Last in the Clouds from Heaven to be reveled
In glory of the Father, to dissolve

Satan with his perverted World, then raise
From the conflagrations mass, purged and refined,
New Heavens, new Earth, Ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.



He ended; and thus Adam last replied.

 How soon hath thy prediction, Seer
blessed,
Measured this transient World, the Race of time,
Till time stand fixed: beyond is all abyss,
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
Of knowledge, what this Vessel can contain;

Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,
And love with fear the only God, to walk
As in his presence, ever to observe
His providence, and on him sole depend,
Merciful over all his works, with good
Still overcoming evil, and by small
Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victory,
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blessed.



To whom thus also th'Angel last replied:

 This having learnt, thou has
attained the sum
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Stars
Thou knew by name, and all the Ethereal Powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heaven, Air, Earth, or Sea,
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
And all the rule, one Empire; only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
Add virtue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
By name to come called Charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A paradise within thee, happier far.
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of Speculation; for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
By me encamped on yonder Hill, expect
Their motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,

In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calmed
Portending good, and all her spirits composed
To meek submission: thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou has heard,
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
The great deliverance by her Seed to come
(For by the Women's Seed) on all Mankind.
That ye may live, which will be many days,
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end.





He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
Descended, Adam to the Bower where Eve

Lay sleeping ran before, but found her waked;
And thus with words not sad she him received.



Whence thou return, and whither went, I know;
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
In me is no delay; with thee to go,
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me
Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence; though all by me is lost,
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.



So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard
Well pleased, but answered not; for now too nigh

the arch-angel stood, and from the other Hill
To their fixed Station, all in bright array
The Cherubim descended; on the ground
Gliding meteor's, as Evening Mist
Risen from a River o'er the marish glides,
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanced,
The brandished Sword of God before them blazed
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
And vapour as the Lybian Air adust,
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering Parents, and to the Eastern Gate
Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
To the subjected Plain; then disappeared.
They looking back, all the Eastern side beheld
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
Waved over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
With dreadful Faces thronged and fiery Arms:
Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;
The World was all before them, where to choose
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow,
Through Eden took their solitary way.
THE END.
