r creeps the ground,
Insect or Worm; those waved their limber fans
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
These as a line their long dimension drew,
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kind
Wondrous in length and corpulence involved
Their Snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept

The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
Of future, in small room large heart enclosed,
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter, joined in her popular Tribes
Of Commonalty: swarming next appeared
The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
With Honey stored: the rest are numberless,
And thou their Natures know, & gave them Names,
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen Eyes
And hairy Main terrific, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heaven in all her Glory shone, and rolled
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
First wheeled their course; Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled; Air, Water, Earth,
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walked
Frequent; and of the Sixth day yet remained;
There wanted yet the Master work, the end
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
And Brute as other Creatures, but endued
With Sanctity of Reason, might erect
His Stature, and upright with Front serene
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in Devotion, to adore
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father (For where is not he
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.


 Let us make now Man in our image, Man
In our similitude, and let them rule
Over the Fish and Foul of Sea and Air,
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
 This said, he formed thee, Adam,
thee O Man
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of Life; in his own Image he
Created thee, in the Image of God
Express, and thou became a living Soul.
Male he created thee, but thy consort
Female for Race; then blessed Mankind, and said,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and fill
the Earth,
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
Over Fish of the Sea, and Foul of the Air,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.

 Wherever thus created, for no
place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste;
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
Variety without end; but of the Tree
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
Thou may not; in the day thou eats, thou did;
Death is the penalty imposed, beware,
And govern well thy appetite, least sin
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
Here finished he, and all that he had made
Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
So Even and Morn accomplished the Sixth day:
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned

Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode,
Thence to behold this new created World
Th'addition of his Empire, how it showed
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how fair,
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand Harps that tuned
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Air
Resounded, (thou remember, for thou heard)
The Heavens and all the Constellations rung,
The Planets in their station listening stood,
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

 Open, ye everlasting Gates,
 they  sung,

 Open, ye Heavens, your living
doors; let in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged Messengers
On errands of supernal Grace.   So
sung
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heaven,
That opened wide her blazing Portals, led
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
And pavement Stars, as Stars to thee appear,
Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky way
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou see
Pouderd with Stars.  And now on Earth the Seventh
Evening arose in Eden, for the Sun
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
Of Heavens high-seated top, the empyreal Throne
Of Godhood, fixed for ever firm and sure,

The Filial Power arrived, and sate him down
With his great Father (for he also went
Invisible, yet staid (such privilege
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,
Author and end of all things, and from work
Now resting, blessed and hallowed the Seventh day,
As resting on that day from all his work,
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
Tempered soft Tunings, intermixed with Voice
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
Creation and the Six days acts they sung,

 Great are thy works, Jehovah,
infinite
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee; greater now in thy return
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
Thy Thunders magnified; but to create
Is greater then created to destroy.
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their Counsels vain
Thou has repealed, while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might: his evil
Thou use, and from thence creates more good.
Witness this new-made World, another Heaven
From Heaven Gate not far, founded in view
On the clear Hyaline, the Glassy Sea;
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's

Numerous, and every Star perhaps a World
Of destined habitation; but thou know
Their seasons: among these the seat of men,
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,
Their pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happy men,
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanced,
Created in his Image, there to dwell
And worship him, and in reward to rule
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
And multiply a Race of Worshippers
Holy and just: thrice happy if they know
Their happiness, and persevere upright.

 So sung they, and the Empyrean
rung,
With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept.
And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked
How first this World and face of things began,
And what before thy memory was don
From the beginning, that posterity
Informed by thee might know; if else thou seeks
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
The End of the Seventh Book.
