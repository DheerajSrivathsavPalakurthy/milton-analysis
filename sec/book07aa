            Paradise Lost. BOOK VII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Raphael at the request of Adam relates how and
wherefore  this  world was first created; that God, after the 
expelling  of 
Satan and his Angels out of Heaven, declar'd his 
pleasure  to  create  another World and other Creatures to  dwell 
therein;  sends his Son with Glory and attendance of Angels to perform 
the  work  of Creation in six days: the Angels celebrate  with  Hymns 
the performance thereof, and his resignation into Heaven.


DEscend from Heaven Urania, by that
name
If rightly thou art called, whose Voice divine
Following, above theOlympian Hill I soar,
Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heavenly borne,
Before the Hills appeared, or Fountain flowed,

Thou with Eternal wisdom did converse,
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her did play
In presence of the almighty Father, pleased
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
An Earthly Guest, and drawn Imperial Air,
Thy tampering; with like safety guided down
Return me to my Native Element:
Least from this flying Steed unreingned, (as once

Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime)
Dismounted, on theAleian Field I fall
Erroneous there to wander and forlorn.
Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
Within the visible Diurnal Sphere;
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchanged
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,

Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race
Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard
In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Ears
To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
For thou are Heavenly, she an empty dream.


Say Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned

Adam by dire example to beware 

Apostasy, by what befell in Heaven
To those Apostates, least the like befall
In Paradise to Adam or his Race,
Charged not to touch the interdicted Tree,
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
So easily obeyed amid the choice
Of all tastes else to please their appetite,
Though wandering.  He with his consorted Eve

The story heard attentive, and was filled
With admiration, and deep Muse to hear
Of things so high and strange, things to their thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heaven,
And War so near the Peace of God in bliss
With such confusion: but the evil soon
Driven back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
With Blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
Led on, yet sunless, with desire to know
What nearer might concern him, how this World
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began,
When, and whereof created, for what cause,
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory, as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
Proceeded thus to ask his Heavenly Guest.



Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,
Far differing from this World, thou has revealed
Divine interpreter, by favour sent
Down from the Empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach:
For which to the infinitely Good we owe

Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his soverign will, the end
Of what we are.  But since thou has Vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concerned
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known,
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high, with moving Fires adorned
Innumerable, and this which yields or fills
All space, the ambient Air wide interfus'd
Embracing round this florid Earth, what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy Rest
Through all Eternity so late to build
In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon
Absolved, if unforbid thou may unfold
What wee, not to explore the secrets ask
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
To magnify his works, the more we know.
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
Much of his Race though steep, suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His Generation, and the rising Birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the Star of Evening and the Moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch,
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.



Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought:


And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.



 This also thy request with
caution asked
Obtain: though to recount Almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou can attain, which best may serve
To glorify the Maker, and infer
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing, such Commission from above
I have received, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in Night,
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Enough is left besides to search and know.
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain,
Oppresses else with Surfeit, and soon turns
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Wind.


Know then, that after Lucifer from Heaven
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
Of Angels, then that Star the Stars among)
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
Into his place, and the great Son returned
Victorious with his Saints, The Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.



At least our envious Foe hath failed, who  thought
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength, the seat
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,
He trusted to have seized, and into fraud
Drew many, whom their place knows here no more;

Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,
Their station, Heaven yet populous retains
Number sufficient to possess her Realms
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
With Ministries due and solemn Rites:
But least his heart exalt him in the harm
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heaven
My damage fondly deemed, I can repair
That detriment, if such it be to lose
Self-lost, and in a moment will create
Another World, out o
