 Chariots raged; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming voles flew,
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
So under fiery Cope together rushed
Both Battles maine, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage; all Heaven
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These Elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their Regions: how much more of Power
Army against Army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, their happy Native seat;
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heaven high over-ruled
And limited their might; though numbered such
As each divided Legion might have seemed
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemed
Each Warrior single as in Chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of Battle, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim War; no thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed

That argued fear; each on himself relied,
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory; deeds of eternal fame
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spread
That War and various; sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemed then
Conflicting Fire: long time in even scale
The Battle hung; till Satan, who that day
Prodigious power had shown, and met in Arms
No equal, ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and felled
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and opposed the rocky Orb
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
A vast circumference: At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
Surceased, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine War in Heaven, the arch foe subdued
Or Captive dragged in Chains, with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began.



Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous, as thou see
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
And thy adherents: how has thou disturb d
Heavens blessed peace, and into Nature brought
Misery, uncreated till the crime
Of thy Rebellion? how has thou instilled
Thy malice into thousands, once upright
And faithful, now proved false.  But think not here

To trouble Holy Rest; Heaven casts thee out
From all her Confines.  Heaven the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and War.
Hence then, and evil go with thee along
Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broils,
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doom,
Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
Precipitate thee with augmented pain.



So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
The Adversary.  Nor think thou with
wind
Of airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds
Thou can not.  has thou turned the least of these
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquished, easier to transact with me
That thou should hope, imperious, and with threats
To chase me hence? err not that so shall end
The strife which thou call evil, but wee style
The strife of Glory: which we mean to win,
Or turn this Heaven it self into the Hell
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
And join him named Almighty to thy aid,
I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.



They ended parley, and both addressed for fight
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
Human imagination to such height
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemed,
Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heaven.
Now waved their fiery Swords, and in the Air
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns their Shields

Blazed opposite, while expectation stood
In horror; from each hand with speed retired
Where erst was thickest fight, the Angelic throng,
And left large field, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion, such as to set forth
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
Among the Constellations war were sprung,
Two Planets rushing from aspect malign
Of fiercest opposition in mid Sky,
Should combat, and their jarring Spears confound.
Together both with next to Almighty Arm,
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed
That might determine, and not need repeat,
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeared
In might or swift prevention; but the sword
Of Michael from the Armoury of God
Was given him tempered so, that neither keen
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
Descending, and in half cut sheer, nor staid,
But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering shared
All his right side; then Satan first knew pain,
And writhed him to and fro convolv'd; so sore
The griding sword with discontinuous wound
Passed through him, but the Ethereal substance closed
Not long divisible, and from the gash
A stream of Nectarous humour issuing flowed
Sanguine, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
And all his Armour stained ere while so bright.
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
By Angels many and strong, who interposed
Defence, while others bore him on their Shields
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retired
From off the files of war; there they him laid

Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless, and his pride
Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath
His confidence to equal God in power.
Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man
In Entrails, Heart or Head, Liver or Reins;
Cannot but by annihilating die;
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
Receive, no more then can the fluid Air:
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Ear,
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.


Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
And with fierce Ensigns pierced the deep array
Of Moloc furious King, who him defied,
And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
Down cloven to the waste, with shattered Arms
And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing

Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armed,
Vanquished Adramelec, and Asmadai,
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
Mangled with ghastly wounds through Plate and Mail,
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
The Atheist crew, but with redoubled blow

Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew.
I might relate of thousands, and their names

Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
In might though wondrous and in Acts of War,
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doom
Concealed from Heaven and sacred memory,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
And ignominy, yet to glory aspires
Vain glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
Therefore Eternal silence be their doom.


And now their Mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
With many an inrode gored; deformed rout
Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiverd armour strewn, and on a heap
Chariot and Charioteer lay overturn
And fiery foaming Steeds; what stood, recoiled
Overwearied, through the faint Satanic Host
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience, till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or pain.
Far otherwise th'inviolable Saints
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanced entire,
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed:
Such high advantages their innocence
Gave them above their foes, not to have send,
Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
By wound, though from their place by violence moved.


Now Night her course began, and over Heaven
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,

And silence on the odious din of War:
Under her Cloudy covert both retired,
Victor and Vanquished: on the foughten field

Michael and his Angels prevalent
Encamping, placed in Guard their Watches round,
Cherubic waving fires: on the other part

Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
Far in the dark dislodged, and void of rest,
His Potentates to Council called by night;
And in the midst thus undismayed began.



O now in danger tried, now known in Arms
Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,
Found worthy not of Liberty alone,
Too mean pretence, but what we more affect,
Honour, Dominion, Glory, and renown,
Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight
(And if one day, why not Eternal days?)
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his Throne, and judged
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,
Some disadvantage we endured and pain,
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
Since now we find this our Imperial form
Incapable of mortal injury
Imperishable, and though pierced with wound,
Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
Of evil then so small as easy think
The remedy; perhaps more valid Arms,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
Or equal what between us made the odds,

In Nature none: if other hidden cause
Left them Superior, while we can preserve
Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,
Due search and consultation will disclose.
