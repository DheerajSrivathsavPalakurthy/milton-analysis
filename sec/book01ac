ood on the bare strand,
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, dared fix
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods adored
Among the Nations round, and dared abide

Jehovah thundering out of Zion, throned
Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed

Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,
Abominations; and with cursed things
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profaned,
And with their darkness dared affront his light.
First Moloch, horrid King besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
Though for the noise of Drums and Timbrels loud
Their children's cries unheard, that past through fire
To his grim Idol.  Him the Ammonite

Worshipped in Rabba and her watery Plain,
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream 
Of utmost Arnon.  Not content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
His Temple right against the Temple of God
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
The pleasant Valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called, the Type of Hell.
Next Chemos, the obscene dread of Moabs Sons,
From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
Of Southernmost Abarim; in Hesebon

And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond
The flowery Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,
And Eleale to the Asphaltick Pool.

Peor his other Name, when he enticed

Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile

To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarged
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
With these came they, who from the bordring flood
Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts

Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names

Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,
Not tied or manacled with joint or limb,
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,
Can execute their aerie purposes,
And works of love or enmity fulfil.
For those the Race of Israel oft forsook
Their living strength, and unfrequented left
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low
Bowed down in Battle, sunk before the Spear
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop
Came Astoreth, whom the Ph??nicians called

Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent Horns;
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon

Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,
In Zion also not unsung, where stood
Her Temple on the offensive Mountain, built
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
Beguiled by fair Idolatresses, fell
To Idols foul.  Thammuz came next behind,
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
While smooth Adonis from his native Rock
Ran purple to the Sea, supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale
Infected Sions daughters with like heat,
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch

Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led

His eye surveyed the dark Idolatries
Of alienated Judah.  Next came one
Who mourned in earnest, when the Captive Ark
Maimed his brute Image, head and hands lopped off
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
Where he fell flat, and shamed his Worshippers:

Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon

And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile Banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gained a King,

Ahaz his sottish Conqueror, whom he drew
Gods Altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offerings, and adore the Gods
Whom he had vanquished.  After these appeared
A crew who under Names of old Renown,

Osiris, Isis, Orus and their
 some copies have their  Train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek
Their wandering Gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather then human.  Nor did Israel escape
The infection when their borrowed Gold composed
The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,

Jehovah, who in one Night when he passed
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. 



Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoked; yet who more oft then he
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noise
Of riot ascends above their  some copies have  theirloftiest Towers,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
Exposed a Matron to avoid worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might;
The rest were long to tell, though far renowned,
The Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held
Gods, yet confessed later then Heaven and Earth
Their boasted Parents; Titan Heavens first born
With his enormous brood, and birthright seized
By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove

His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;
So Jove usurping reigned: these first in Create

And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle Air
Their highest Heaven; or on the Delphian Cliff,
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old
Fled over Atria to the Hesperian Fields,
And ore the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. 
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appeared

Obscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
Their fencing courage, and dispel'd their fears.
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claimed

Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurled
The Imperial Ensign, which full high advanced
Shone like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
With Gems and Golden lustre rich emblazed,
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
Sonorous mettle blowing Martial sounds:
At which the universal Host upsent
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
A Forest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
Appeared, and serried Shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as raised
To height of noblest temper Hero's old
Arming to Battle, and in stead of rage
Deliberate valour breathed, firm and unmoved
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swag
With solemn touches, troubled thoughts, and chase


Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Moved on in silence to soft Pipes that charmed
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil; and now
Advanced in view, they stand, a horrid Front
Of dreadful length and dazzling Arms, in guise
Of Warriors old with ordered Spear and Shield,
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief
Had to impose: He through the armed Files
Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse
The whole Battalion views, their order due,
Their visages and stature as of Gods,
Their number last he sums.  And now his heart
Distends with pride, and hardening in his strength
Glories: For never since created man,
Met such embodied force, as named with these
Could merit more then that small infantry
Warred on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
Of Phlegra with the Heroic Race were joined
That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side
Mixed with auxiliary Gods;  and what resounds
In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons
Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;
And all who since, Baptised or Infidel
Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,

Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond

Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell
By Fontarabbia.  Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed
Their dread commander: he above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a Towr; his form had y
