Plainlier shall be reveled.  This Patriarch blessed,
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
The Grandchild with twelve Sons increased, departs
From Canaan, to a Land hereafter called

Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
He comes invited by a younger Son
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that Realm
Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race

Growing into a Nation, and now grown
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably, and kills their infant Males:
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call

Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim
His people from enthralling, they return
With glory and spoil back to their promised Land.
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
To know their God, or message to regard,
Must be compelled by Signs and Judgements dire;
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turned,
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;
His Cattle must of Rot and Murren die,
Botches and blaines must all his flesh emboss,
And all his people; Thunder mixed with Hail,
Hail mixed with fire must rend theEgyptian Sky
And wheel on the Earth, devouring where it rolls;
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Grain,
A darksome Cloud of Locusts swarming down
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
The River-dragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart, and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
More hardened after thaw, till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the Sea
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass

As on dry land between two crystal walls,
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel, who shall go
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire,
To guide them in their journey, and remove
Behind them, while the obdurate King pursues:
All night he will pursue, but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his Host
And craze their Chariot wheels: when by command

Moses once more his potent Rod extends
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
On their embattled ranks the Waves return,
And overwhelm their War: the Race elect
Safe towards Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
Least entering on the Canaanite alarmed
War terrify them inexpert, and fear
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude; for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untraind in Arms, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
Their government, and their great Senate choose
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordained:
God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound


Ordain them Laws; part such as appertain
To civil Justice, part religious Rites
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful; they beseech
That Moses might report to them his will,
And terror cease; he grants what they besought
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high Office now

Moses in figure bears, to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
And all the Prophets in their Age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites
Established, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafed
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescription a Sanctuary is framed
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
The Records of his Covenant, over these
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
Seven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
The Heavenly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleam by Night,
Save when they journey, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel to the Land
Promised to Abraham and his Seed: the rest
Were long to tell, how many Battles fought,
How many Kings destroyed, and Kingdoms won,

Or how the Sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourn,
Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,
And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon,
Till Israel overcome; so call the third
From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.



Here Adam interposed. 
O  sent from Heaven,
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things
Thou has reveled, those chiefly which concern
Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I find
Mine eyes true opening, and my heart much eased,
Erwhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
Of me and all Mankind; but now I see
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blessed,
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on Earth
So many and so various Laws are given;
So many Laws argue so many sins
Among them; how can God with such reside?



To whom thus Michael.
 Doubt  not but that sin
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
And therefore was Law given them to evince
Their natural pravitie, by stirring up
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
Law can discover sin, but not remove,
Save by those shadowy expiations weak,
The blood of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man,
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
To them by Faith imputed, they may find


Justification towards God, and peace
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
Perform, and not performing cannot live.
So law appears imperfect, and but given
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better Covenant, disciplined
From shadowy Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
From imposition of strict Laws, to free
Acceptance of large Grace, from servile fear
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
Highly beloved, being but the Minister
Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;
But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
The adversary Serpent, and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness long wandered man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Meanwhile they in their earthly Canaan placed
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt their public peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemie
