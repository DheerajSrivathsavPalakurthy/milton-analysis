            Paradise Lost. Book VI.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Raphael continues to relate how Michael and
Gabriel were  sent forth to battle against Satan and
his Angels.  The  first Fight described: Satan and his
Powers retire under  Night: He calls a Council, invents devilish
Engines, which in the  second days Fight put Michael and his
Angels to some disorder;   but they at length pulling up Mountains
overwhelmed both the  force and Machins of Satan: Yet the
Tumult not so ending, God  on the third day sends Messiah his
Son, for whom he had  reserved the glory of that Victory: He in the
Power of his  Father coming to the place, and causing all his Legions to
stand  still on either side, with his Chariot and Thunder driving into 
the midst of his Enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards  the
wall of Heaven;  which opening, they leap down with horror  and
confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in  the Deep:
Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.



ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursued
Through Heavens wide Champagne held his way, till Morn,
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
Unbarred the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven, arrayed in Gold
Imperial, from before her vanished Night,
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
Coverd with thick embattled Squadrons bright,
Chariots and flaming Arms, and fiery Steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct, and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly Powers who him received
With joy and acclamation loud, that one
That of so many Myriads fallen, yet one
Returned not lost: On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice
From midst a Golden Cloud thus mild was heard.



Servant of God, well done, well has thou  fought
The better fight, who single has maintained
Against revolted multitudes the Cause
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Arms;
And for the testimony of Truth has born    


Universal reproach, far worse to bear
Then violence: for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God, though Worlds
Judged thee perverse: the easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Then scorned thou did depart, and to subdue
By force, who reason for their Law refuse,
Right reason for their Law, and for their King

Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns.
Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince,
And thou in Military prowess next

Gabriel, lead forth to Battle these my Sons
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
By Thousands and by Millions ranged for fight;
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
Into their place of punishment, the Gulf
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.



So spake the Soverign voice, and Clouds began
To darken all the Hill, and smoke to roll
In dusky wreathes, reluctant flames, the sign
Of wrath awaked: nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal Trumpet from on high began blow:
At which command the Powers Militant,
That stood for Heaven, in mighty Quadrate join"d
Of Union irresistible, moved on
In silence their bright Legions, to the sound
Of instrumental Harmony that breathed
Heroic Ardor to adventurous deeds
Under their God-like Leaders, in the Cause

Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
Indissoluble firm; nor obvious Hill,
Nor straitening Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
Their march was, and the passive Air upbore
Their nimble tread, as when the total kind
Of Birds in orderly array on wing
Came summoned over Eden to receive
Their names of thee; so over many a tract
Of Heaven they marched, and many a Province wide
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
Far in the Horizon to the North appeared
From skirt to skirt a fiery Region, stretched
In battailous aspect, and nearer view
Bristled with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets thronged, and Shields
Various, with boastful Argument portrait,
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
With furious expedition; for they weend
That self same day by fight, or by surprise
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
To set the envier of his State, the proud
Aspirer, but their thoughts proved fond and vain
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemed
At first, that Angel should with Angel war,
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
So oft in Festivals of joy and love
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
Hymning the Eternal Father: but the shout
Of Battle now began, and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
High in the midst exalted as a God
the apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
Idol of Majesty Divine, enclosed 


With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length: before the cloudy Van,
On the rough edge of battle ere it join,d,

Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced,
Came towering, armed in Adamant and Gold;

Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.



O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain, where faith and realty
Remain not; wherefore should not strength and might
There fail where Virtue fails, or weakest prove
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
His puissance, trusting in the almighty's aide,
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tried
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
Most reason is that Reason overcome.



So pondering, and from his armed Peers
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
His daring foe, at this prevention more
Incensed, and thus securely him defied.



Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached
The height of thy aspiring unopposed,
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
Abandoned at the terror of thy Power
Or potent tongue; foo, not to think how vain

Against The Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have raised incessant Armies to defeat
Thy folly; or with solitary hand
Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
Unaided could have finished thee, and whelmed
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou see
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
Prefer, and Piety to God, though then
To thee not visible, when I alone
Seemed in thy World erroneous to dissent
From all: my Sect thou see, now learn too late
How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.



Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in
wished hour
Of my revenge, first sought for thou return
From flight, seditious Angel, to receive
Thy merited reward, the first assay
Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue
Inspired with contradiction dared oppose
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
Their Deities to assert, who while they feel
Vigour Divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou come
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
From me some Plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest: this pause between
(Unanswered least thou boast) to let thee know;
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
To heavenly Souls had bin all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Ministering Spirits, trained up in Feast and Song;
Such has thou armed, the Minstrelsy of Heaven,
Servility with freedom to contend,


As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.



To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.

 Apostate, still thou erst, nor end
wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depraves it with the name
Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthralled;
Yet lewdly dare our ministering upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let me serve
In Heaven God ever blessed, and his Divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed,
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
From me returned, as erst thou said, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

 So saying, a noble stroke he
lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
His massy Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had pushed a Mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seized
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
Thus foiled their mightiest, ours joy filled, and shout,
Presage of Victory and fierce desire
Of Battle: whereat Michael bid sound
The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven

It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung

Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joined
The horrid shock: now storming fury rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing brayed
Horrible discord, and the matting Wheels
Of brazen
