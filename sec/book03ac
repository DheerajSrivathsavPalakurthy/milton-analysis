ound
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 

To Heaven removed where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls o'er Elision Flours her Amber stream;
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks enwreathed with beams,
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shone
Inpurpled with Celestial Roses smiled.
Then Crowned again their golden Harps they took,
Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Pr??amble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.


Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shades
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his Glory abides,
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.

He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created, and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations: thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder did not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
Heavens everlasting Frame, while o'er the necks
Thou drove of warring Angels disarrayed.
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Fathers might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
Not so on Man; him through their malice fallen,
Father of Mercy and Grace, thou did not doom
So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
Of Mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
Regardless of the Bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee, offered himself to die
For mans offence.  O unexampled love,
Love no where to be found less then Divine!
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
Shall be the copious matter of my Song
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin.



Thus they in Heaven, above the starry Sphere,
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
Of this round World, whose first convex divides
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,

Satan alighted walks: a Globe far off
It seemed, now seems a boundless Continent 

Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
Starless exposed, and ever-threatning storms
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far some small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
As when a Vulture on Imaus bred,
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
But in his way lights on the barren Plains
Of Sericana, where Chinese drive
With Sails and Wind their canie Waggons light:
So on this windy Sea of Land, the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey,
Alone, for other Creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none,
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like Aerial vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain, when Sin
With vanity had filled the works of men:
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of Glory or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or the other life;
All who have their reward on Earth, the fruits
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 

Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamt;
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the Angelical and Human kind:
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
First from the ancient World those Giants came
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
The builders next of Babel on the Plain
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
Others came single; he who to be deemed
A God, leaped fondly into ??tna flames,

Empedocles, and he who to enjoy

Plato's Elysium, leaped into the Sea,

Cleombrotus, and many more too long,
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friars
White, Black and Grey, with all their trumpery.
Here Pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixed,
And that Crystalline Sphere whose balance weighs
The Trepidation talked, and that first moved;
And now Saint Peter at Heavens Wicket seems
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their Feet, when lo
A violent cross wind from either Coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
Into the devious Air; then might ye see
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with their wearers tossed
And fluttered into Rags, then Relics, Beads, 

Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
The sport of Winds: all these appareled aloft
Fly o'er the backside of the World far off
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
Long after, now unpeopled, and untrod;
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passed,
And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
His travelled steps; far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
At top whereof, but far more rich appeared
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
With Frontispiece of Diamond and Gold
Embellished, thick with sparkling orient Gems
The Portal shone, inimitable on Earth
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
Dreaming by night under the open Sky,
And waking cried, This is the Gate of Heaven

Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flowed
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearl, whereon
Who after came from Earth, sailing arrived,
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the Lake
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of Bliss. 

Direct against which opened from beneath,
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,
A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,
Wider by far then that of after-times
Over Mount Zion, and, though that were large,
Over the Promised Land to God so dear,
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
On high behests his Angels to and fro
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land

Borders on ??gypped and the Arabian shore;
So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.

Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of Gold to Heaven Gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
Which to his eye di
