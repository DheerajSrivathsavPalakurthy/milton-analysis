et: and these scarce blown,
Forth flourished thick the clustering Vine, forth crept
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
Embattled in her field: and the humble Shrub,
And Bush with frizzled hair implicit: last
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spread
Their branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd
Their blossoms: with high woods the hills were crowned,
With tufts the valleys and each fountain side,
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now
Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
None was, but from the Earth a dewy Mist
Went up and watered all the ground, and each
Plant of the field, which ever it was in the Earth
God made, and every Herb, before it grew
On the green stem; God saw that it was good.
So Even and Morn recorded the Third Day.


Again the almighty spake: 
Let there be Lights
High in the expanse of Heaven to divide
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signs,
For Seasons, and for Days, and circling Years,
And let them be for Lights as I ordain
Their Office in the Firmament of Heaven
To give Light on the Earth;  and
it was so.
And God made two great Lights, great for their use
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
The less by Night alterne: and made the Stars,

And set them in the Firmament of Heaven
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
In their vicissitude, and rule the Night,
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
A mighty Sphere he framed, unlightsom first,
Though of Ethereal Mould: then formed the Moon
Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,
And sowed with Stars the Heaven thick as a field:
Of Light by far the greater part he took,
Transplanted from her cloudy Shrine, and placed
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retain
Her gathered beams, great Palace now of Light.
Hither as to their Fountain other Stars
Repairing, in their golden Urns draw Light,
And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns;
By tincture or reflection they augment
Their small peculiar, though from human sight
So far remote, with diminution seen.
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
Regent of Day, and all the Horizon round
Invested with bright Rays, jocund to run
His Longitude through Heavens high rode: the gray
Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
But opposite in leveled West was set
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
From him, for other light she needed none
In that aspect, and still that distance keeps
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
Revolved on Heavens great Axle, and her Reign
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,

With thousand thousand Stars, that then appeared
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adorned
With their bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
Glad Evening and glad Morn crowned the fourth day.


And God said,  let the Waters
generate
Reptile with Spawn abundant, living Soul:
And let Foul fly above the Earth, with wings
Displayed on the open Firmament of Heaven.

 And God created the great Whales,
and each
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
The waters generated by their kinds,
And every Bird of wing after his kind;
And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and in the
Seas
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
And let the Foul be multiplied on the Earth.

 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas,
each Creek and Bay
With Fry innumerable swarm, and Shoals
Of Fish that with their Finns and shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculls that oft
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
Graze the Sea weed their pasture, and through Groves
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
Show to the Sun their waved coats dropped with Gold,
Or in their Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks their food
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seal,
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their Gate
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
Stretched like a Promontory sleeps or swims,
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gills
Draws in, and at his Trunk spouts out a Sea.

Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shores
Their Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
Their callow young, but feathered soon and fledge
They summed their Pens, and soaring the air sublime
With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
On Cliffs and Cedar tops their Eyries build:
Part loosely wing the Region, part more wise
In common, ranged in figure wedge their way,
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
Their Aerie Caravan high over Sea's
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
Easing their flight; so steers the prudent Crane
Her annual Voyage, born on Winds; the Air
Floats, as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
Solaced the Woods, and spread their painted wings
Till Even, nor then the solemn Nightingale
Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays:
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bathed
Their downy Breast; the Swan with Arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rows
Her state with Oar feet: yet oft they quit
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, tower
The mid Aerial Sky: Others on ground
Walked firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours, and the other whose gay Train
Adorns him, coloured with the Florid hue
Of Rainbows and Starry Eyes.  The Waters thus
With Fish replenished, and the Air with Foul,
Evening and Morn solemnised the Fifth day.


The Sixth, and of Creation last arose
With Evening Harps and Mitten, when God said,


 Let the Earth bring forth Foul
living in her kind,
Cattle and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
Each in their kind.   The Earth
obeyed, and strait
Opening her fertile Womb teemed at a Birth
numerous living Creatures, perfect forms,
Limbed and full grown: out of the ground up rose
As from his Lair the wilde Beast where he one
In Forest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walked:
The Cattle in the Fields and Meadows green:
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
The grassy Clods now Calv'd, now half appeared
The Tawny Lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
The Leopard, and the Tiger, as the Moil
Rising, the crumbled Earth above them threw
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head: scarce from his mould

Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
His vastness: Fleeced the Flocks and bleating rose,
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
The River Horse and scaly Crocodile.
At once came forth whateve
