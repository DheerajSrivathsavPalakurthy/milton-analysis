all my nether shape thus grew
Transformed: but he my inbred enemy
Forth issued, brandishing his fatal Dart
Made to destroy: I fled, and cried out Death;
Hell trembled at the hideous Name, and sighed
From all her Caves, and back resounded Death.
I fled, but he pursued (though more, it seems,
Inflamed with lust then rage) and swifter far,
Me overtook his mother all dismayed,
And in embraces forcible and foul
Engendering with me, of that rape begot
These yelling Monsters that with ceaseless cry
Surround me, as thou saw, hourly conceived
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
To me, for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return, and howl and gnaw
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth
A fresh with conscious terrors vex me round,
That rest or intermission none I find.
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on,
And me his Parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey, but that he knows
His end with mine involved; and knows that I
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounced.
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,

Though tempered heavenly, for that mortal dint,
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.



She finished, and the subtle Fiend his lore
Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth.

Dear Daughter, since thou clammiest me for thy Sire,
And my fair Son here shows me, the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
Befallen us unforeseen, unthought of, know
I come no enemy, but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,
Both him and thee, and all the heavenly Host
Of Spirits that in our just pretences armed
Fell with us from on high: from them I go
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread
The unfounded deep, and through the void immense
To search with wandering quest a place foretold
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now
Created vast and round, a place of bliss
In the Purlieus of Heaven, and therein placed
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply
Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,
Least Heaven surcharged with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broils: Be this or aught
Then this more secret now designed, I haste
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom Air, embalmed
With odours; there ye shall be fed and filled
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.

He ceased, for both seemed highly pleased, and Death
Grinnd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear 


His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour: no less rejoiced
His mother bad, and thus bespoke her Sire.



The key of this infernal Pit by due,
And by command of Heavens all-powerful King
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
These Adamantine Gates; against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
Fearless to be overmatched by living might.
But what ow I to his commands above
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,
To sit in hateful Office here confined,
Inhabitant of Heaven, and heavenly-born,
Here in perpetual agony and pain,
With terrors and with clamours compassed round
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou
My being gave me; whom should I obey
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss, among
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.



Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
And towards the Gate rolling her bestial train,
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
Which but her self not all the Stygian powers
Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns
Thunderstorm wards, and every Bolt and Bar
Of massy Iron or solid Rock with ease
Unfastens: on a sudden open fly
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound 

The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
Of Erebus.  She opened, but to shut
Excelled her power; the Gates wide open stood,
That with extended wings a Bannered Host
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
With Horse and Chariots ranked in loose array;
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.
Before their eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoary deep, a dark
Illimitable Ocean without bound,
Without dimension, where length, breadth, & height,
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
And Chaos.  Ancestors of Nature, hold
Eternal Anarchy, amidst the noise
Of endless Wars, and by confusion stand.
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battle bring
Their embryon Atoms; they around the flag
Of each his Faction, in their several Clanns,
Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
Swarm populous, unnumbered as the Sands
Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
Their lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,
He rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,
And by decision more embroils the fray
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter

Chance governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, 


Unless the almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more Worlds,
Into this wild Abyss the wary fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
He had to cross.  Nor was his ear less pealed
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
Great things with small) then when Bellona storms,
With all her battering Engines bent to raise
Some Capital City; or less then if this frame
Of Heaven were falling, and these Elements
In mutiny had from her Axle torn
The steadfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoke
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
A vast vacuity: all unawares
Fluttering his pennons vain plumb down he drops
Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft: that fury stayed,
Quenched in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,
Nor good dry Land: nigh foundered on he fares,
Treading the crude consistency, half on foot,
Half flying; behoves him now both Oar and Sail.
As when a Griffin through the Wilderness
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth
Had from his wakeful custody purloined
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,

With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way,
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies:
At length a universal hubbub wilde
Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
Born through the hollow dark assaults his ear
With loudest vehemence: thither he plies,
Undaunted to meet there what ever power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthroned
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood

Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name
Of Demogorgon; Rumour next and Chance,
And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled,
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.


They whom Satan turning boldly, thus.
 Ye Powers
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,

Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy,
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint
Wandering this darksome Desert, as my way,
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
Confine with Heaven; or if some other place
From your Dominion won, the Ethereal King
Possesses lately, thither to arrive
I travel this profound, direct my course;
Directed no mean recompense it brings
To your behoof, if I that Region lost, 

All usurpation thence expelled, reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
(Which is my present journey) and once more
Erect the Standard there of ancient Night;
Yours be the advantage all, mine the revenge.



Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old
With faltering speech and visage incompos'd
Answered.  I know thee, stranger,
who thou art,
That mighty leading Angel, who of late
Made head against Heavens King, though overthrown.
I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven Gates
Poured out by millions her victorious Bands
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontiers here
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
That little which is left so to defend,
Encroached on still through our intestine broils
Weakening the Sceptre of old Night: first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
Hung ore my Realm, linked in a golden Chain
To that side Heaven from whence your Legions fell:
If that way be your walk, you have not far;
So much the nearer danger; go and speed;
Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain.



He ceased; and Satan staid not to reply,
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
With fresh alacrity and force renewed
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
Environed wins his way; harder beset 

And more endangered, then when Argo passed
Through Bosporus betwixt the jostling Rocks:
Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunned

Charybdis, and by the other whirlpool steered.
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;
But he once past, soon after when man fell,
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain
Following his track, such was the will of Heaven,
Paved after him a broad and beaten way
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
Tamely endured a Bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continued reaching th'utmost Orb
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
With easy intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace.
But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire
As from her outmost works a brok'd foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din,
That Satan with less toil, and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold
Far off the Empyreal Heaven, extended wide
In circuit, undetermined square or round,
With Opal Towers and Battlements adorned
Of living Sapphire, once his native Seat; 

And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
This pendant world, in bigness as a Star
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
Accursed, and in a cursed hour he hies.
The End of the Second Book.
