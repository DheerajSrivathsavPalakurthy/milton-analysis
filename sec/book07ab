f one man a Race
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
Not here, till by degrees of merit raised
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience tried,
And Earth be changed to Heaven, & Heaven to Earth,
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven,
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth,
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I uncircumscribed my self retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessity and Chance
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.



So spake the almighty, and to what he spake
His Word, the filial Godhood, gave effect.
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
Then time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,


So told as earthly notion can receive.
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
When such was heard declared the Almightie's will;
Glory they sung to the most High, good will
To future men, and in their dwellings peace:
Glory to him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out th'ungodly from his sight
And th'habitations of the just; to him
Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create, in stead
Of Spirits malign a better Race to bring
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
On his great Expedition now appeared,
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine, Sapience and Love
Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
About his Chariot numberless were poured
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
And Virtues, winged Spirits, and Chariots winged,
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodged
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
The King of Glory in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore
They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,

Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Heavens height, and with the Center mix the Pole.



Silence, ye troubled waves, and thou Deep, peace,

 Said then th'Omnific Word,
 your  discord end:

 Nor staid, but on the Wings of
Cherubim
Uplifted, in Paternal Glory rode
Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;
For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Train
Followed in bright procession to behold
Creation, and the wonders of his might.
Then staid the fervid Wheels, and in his hand
He took the golden Compasses, prepared
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
This Universe, and all created things:
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure,
And said,  thus far extend, thus
far thy bounds,
This be thy just Circumference, O World.

 Thus God the Heaven created, thus
the Earth,
Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound
Covered th'Abyss: but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purged
The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
Like things to like, the rest to several place
Disported, and between spun out the Air,
And Earth self balanced on her Center hung.



Let there be Light,  said God,
and  forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
To journey through the airy gloom began,


Sphered in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
Was not; she in a cloudy Tabernacle
Sojourned the while.  God saw the Light was good;
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
He named.  Thus was the first Day Even and Morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
The hollow Universal Orb they filled,
And touched their Golden Harps, and hymning praised
God and his works, Creator him they sung,
Both when first Evening was, and when first Morn.


Again, God said,  let there be
Firmament
Amid the Waters, and let it divide
The Waters from the Waters:  and
God made
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
The Waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
Built on circumfluous Waters calm, in wide
Crystalline Ocean, and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed, least fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heaven he named the Firmament: So Even
And Morning Chorus sung the second Day.


The Earth was formed, but in the Womb as yet
Of Waters, Embryon immature involved,
Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
Main Ocean flowed, not idle, but with warm
Prolific humour softening all her Globe,

Fermented the great Mother to conceive,
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said

 Be gathered now ye Waters under
Heaven
Into one place, and let dry Land appear.

 Immediately the Mountains huge
appear
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
Into the Clouds, their tops ascend the Sky:
So high as heaved the tumid Hills, so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry;
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
For haste; such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods: as Armies at the call
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou has heard)
Troop to their Standard, so the watery throng,
Wave rolling after Wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plain,
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With Serpent error wandering, found their way,
And on the wash Ooze deep Channels wore;
Easy, ever God had bid the ground be dry,
All but within those banks, where Rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
Of congregated Waters he called Seas:
And saw that it was good, and said,
 Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed,
And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind;
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.

 He scarce had said, when the bare
Earth, till then
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,


Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden floured
Opening their various colours, and made gay
Her bosom smelling swe
