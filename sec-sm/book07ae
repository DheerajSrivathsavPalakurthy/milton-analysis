 when Orient Light
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
The hollow Universal Orb they filled,
And touched their Golden Harps, and hymning praised
God and his works, Creator him they sung,
Both when first Evening was, and when first Morn.


Again, God said,  let there be
Firmament
Amid the Waters, and let it divide
The Waters from the Waters:  and
God made
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
The Waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
Built on circumfluous Waters calm, in wide
Crystalline Ocean, and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed, least fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heaven he named the Firmament: So Even
And Morning Chorus sung the second Day.


The Earth was formed, but in the Womb as yet
Of Waters, Embryon immature involved,
Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
Main Ocean flowed, not idle, but with warm
Prolific humour softening all her Globe,

Fermented the great Mother to conceive,
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said

 Be gathered now ye Waters under
Heaven
Into one place, and let dry Land appear.

 Immediately the Mountains huge
appear
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
Into the Clouds, their tops ascend the Sky:
So high as heaved the tumid Hills, so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry;
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
For haste; such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods: as Armies at the call
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou has heard)
Troop to their Standard, so the watery throng,
Wave rolling after Wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plain,
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With Serpent error wandering, found their way,
And on the wash Ooze deep Channels wore;
Easy, ever God had bid the ground be dry,
All but within those banks, where Rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
Of congregated Waters he called Seas:
And saw that it was good, and said,
 Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed,
And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind;
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.

 He scarce had said, when the bare
Earth, till then
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,


Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden floured
Opening their various colours, and made gay
Her bosom smelling swee
