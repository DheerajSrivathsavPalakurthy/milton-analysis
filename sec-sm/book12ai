d titles, and with these to join
Secular power, though feigning still to act
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God, promised alike and given
To all Believers; and from that pretence,
Spiritual Laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience; Laws which none shall find
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and bind
His consort Liberty; what, but unbuild

His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
Their own Faith not another: for on Earth
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume:
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part,
Will deem in outward Rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of Faith
Rarely be found: so shall the World go on,
To good malignant, to bad men benign,
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just,
And vengeance to the wicked, at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Women's seed, obscurely then foretold,
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
Last in the Clouds from Heaven to be reveled
In glory of the Father, to dissolve

Satan with his perverted World, then raise
From the conflagrations mass, purged and refined,
New Heavens, new Earth, Ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.



He ended; and thus Adam last replied.

 How soon hath thy prediction, Seer
blessed,
Measured this transient World, the Race of time,
Till time stand fixed: beyond is all abyss,
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
Of knowledge, what this Vessel can contain;

Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,
And love with fear the only God, to walk
As in his presence, ever to observe
His providence, and on him sole depend,
Merciful over all his works, with good
Still overcoming evil, and by small
Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victory,
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blessed.



To whom thus also th'Angel last replied:

 This having learnt, thou has
attained the sum
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Stars
Thou knew by name, and all the Ethereal Powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heaven, Air, Earth, or Sea,
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
And all the rule, one Empire; only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
Add virtue, Patien
