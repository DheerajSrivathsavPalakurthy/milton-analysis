 the Peace of God in bliss
With such confusion: but the evil soon
Driven back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
With Blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
Led on, yet sunless, with desire to know
What nearer might concern him, how this World
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began,
When, and whereof created, for what cause,
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory, as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
Proceeded thus to ask his Heavenly Guest.



Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,
Far differing from this World, thou has revealed
Divine interpreter, by favour sent
Down from the Empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach:
For which to the infinitely Good we owe

Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his soverign will, the end
Of what we are.  But since thou has Vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concerned
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known,
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high, with moving Fires adorned
Innumerable, and this which yields or fills
All space, the ambient Air wide interfus'd
Embracing round this florid Earth, what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy Rest
Through all Eternity so late to build
In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon
Absolved, if unforbid thou may unfold
What wee, not to explore the secrets ask
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
To magnify his works, the more we know.
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
Much of his Race though steep, suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His Generation, and the rising Birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the Star of Evening and the Moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch,
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.



Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought:


And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.



 This also thy request with
caution asked
Obtain: though to recount Almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou can attain, which best may serve
To glorify the Maker, and infer
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing, such Commission from above
I have received, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not re
