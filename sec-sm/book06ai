,
As is most just; this I my Glory account,
My exaltation, and my whole delight,
That thou in me well pleased, declare thy will
Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
Sceptre and Power, thy giving, I assume,
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
For ever, and in me all whom thou love:
But whom thou hates, I hate, and can put on
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
Armed with thy might, rid heaven of these rebelled,
To their prepared ill Mansion driven down
To chains of darkness, and the undying Worm,
That from thy just obedience could revolt,
Whom to obey is happiness entire.
Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from th'impure
Far separate, circling thy holy Mount
Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
So said, he o'er his Sceptre bowing, rose
From the right hand of Glory where he sate,

And the third sacred Morn began to shine
Dawning through Heaven: forth rushed with whirlwind sound
The Chariot of Paternal Deity,                   
Flashing thick flames, Wheel within Wheel undrawn,
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyed
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
Had wondrous, as with Stars their bodies all
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
Over their heads a crystal Firmament,
Whereon a Sapphire Throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the shower Arch.
He in Celestial Panoply all armed
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
Ascended, at his right hand Victory
Sate Eagle-winged, beside him hung his Bow
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stored,
And from about him fierce Effusion rolled
Of smoke and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came, far off his coming shone,
And twenty thousand (I their number heard)
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the Crystalline Sky, in Sapphire Throned.
Illustrious far and wide, but by his own
First seen, them unexpected joy surprised,
When the great Ensign of Messiah blazed
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heaven:
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
His Army, circumfus'd on either Wing,
Under their Head embodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepared;
At his command the uprooted Hills retired

Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
Obsequious, Heaven his wonted face renewed,
And with fresh Flowerets Hill and Valley smiled.
This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd,
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what Signs avail,
Or Wonders move th'obdurate to relent?
They hardened more by what might most reclaim,
Grieving to see his Glory, at the sight
Took envy, and aspiring to his height,
Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud
Weaning to prosper, and at length prevail
Against God and Messiah, or to fall
In universal ruin last, and now
To final Battle drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.



Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here  stand
Ye Angels armed, this day from Battle rest;
Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
And as ye have received, so have ye don
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs,
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
Number to this days work is not ordained
Nor multitude, stand only and behold
Gods indignation on these Godless poured
By me, not you but me they have despised,
Yet envied; against me is all their rage,
Because the Father, They whom in Heaven supreme
Kingdom and Power and Glory appertains,

Hath honoured me according to his will.
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;
That they may have their wish, to try with me
In Battle which the stronger proves, they all,
Or I alone ag
