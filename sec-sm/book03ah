ick with sparkling orient Gems
The Portal shone, inimitable on Earth
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
Dreaming by night under the open Sky,
And waking cried, This is the Gate of Heaven

Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flowed
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearl, whereon
Who after came from Earth, sailing arrived,
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the Lake
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of Bliss. 

Direct against which opened from beneath,
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,
A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,
Wider by far then that of after-times
Over Mount Zion, and, though that were large,
Over the Promised Land to God so dear,
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
On high behests his Angels to and fro
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land

Borders on ??gypped and the Arabian shore;
So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.

Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of Gold to Heaven Gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First-seen, or some renowned Metropolis
With glistening Spires and Pinnacles adorned,
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized
At sight of all this World beheld so fair.
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
So high above the circling Canopy
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
Of Libra to the fleecy Star that bears

Andromeda far off Atlantic Seas 

Beyond the Horizon; then from Pole to Pole
He views in breadth, and without longer pause
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
His flight precipitant, and winds with ease
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable Stars, that shone
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other Worlds,
Or other Worlds they seemed, or happy Isles,
Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flowery Vales,
Thrice happy Isles, but who dwelt happy there
He stayed not to enquire: above them all
The golden Sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye: Thither his course he bends
Through the calm Firmament; but up or down
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
Or Longitude, where the great Luminary
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses Light from far; they as they move
Their Starry dance in numbers that compute
Days, months, &years, towards his all-cheering Lamp
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
The Universe, and to each inward part
With gentle penetration, though unseen,
Shoots invisible virtue even
