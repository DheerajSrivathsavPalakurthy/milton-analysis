ich that thou may believe, and be confirmed
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
To show thee what shall come in future days
To thee and to thy Offspring; good with bad
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
True patience, and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow, equally inured
By moderation either state to bear,
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life, and best prepared endure
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend
This Hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wake,
As once thou sleeps, while She to life was formed.



To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.

 Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide,
the path
Thou lead me, and to the hand of Heaven submit,
However chast'ning, to the evil turn
My obvious breast, arming to overcome
By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,
If so I may attain.  So both ascend
In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
The Hemisphere of Earth in clearest Ken

Stretched out to the amplest reach
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
To show him all Earths Kingdoms and their Glory.
His Eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
Of mightiest Empire, from the destined Walls
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can

And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
To Paquin of Sin??an Kings, and thence
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul

Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar

In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,

Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
Th'Empire of Negus to his utmost Port

Ercoco and the less Maritime Kings

Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realm
Of Congo, and Angola farthest South;
Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Suss,

Morocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoiled

Guiana, whose great City Geryons Sons
Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights

Michael from Adams eyes the Film removed
Which that false Fruit that promised clearer sight

Had bred; then purged with Euphrasie and Rue
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
And from the Well of Life three drops instilled.
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierced,
Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,
That Adam now enforced to close his eyes,
Sunk down and all his Spirits became entranced:
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.




Adam, now open thine eyes, and first behold
Th'effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee, who never touched
Th'excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspired,
Nor sinned thy sin, yet from that derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.



His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
New reaped, the other part sheep-walks and folds;
in the midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
Rustic, of grassy sord; thither anon
A sweaty Reaper from his Tillage brought
First Fruits, the green Ear, and the yellow Sheaf,
Uncalled, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
The Inwards and their Fat, with Incense strewed,
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites performed.
His Offering soon propitious Fire from Heaven
Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;
The others not, for his was not sincere;
Whereat he inlie raged, and as they talked,
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
Groaned out his Soul with gushing blood effus'd.

Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
Disma
