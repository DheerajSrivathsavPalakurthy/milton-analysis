s Host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed)
Their Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
Light as the Lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,
From their foundations loosening to and fro
They plucked the seated Hills with all their load,
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggy tops 


Up lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,
Be sure, and terror seized the rebel Host,
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the Mountains upward turned,
Till on those cursed Engines triple-row
They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
Came shadowing, and oppressed whole Legions armed,
Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
The rest in imitation to like Arms
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
So Hills amid the Air encountered Hills
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
Infernal noise; War seemed a civil Game
To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heaven
Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspread,
Had not the almighty Father where he sits
shrined in his Sanctuary of Heaven secure,
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
To honour his Anointed Son avenged
Upon his enemies, and to declare
All power on him transferred: whence to his Son
Th'Assessor of his Throne he thus began.


 Effulgence of my Glory, Son beloved,
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly, what by Deity I am,
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
Second Omnipotence, two days are past,
Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient; sore hath been their fight,
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met armed;
For to themselves I left them, and thou know,
Equal in their Creation they were formed,
Save what sin hath impaired, which yet hath wrought
Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless, and no solution will be found:
War wearied hath performed what War can do,
And to disordered rage let loose the reins,
With Mountains as with Weapons armed, which makes
Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the maine.
Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;
For thee I have ordained it, and thus far
Have suffered, that the Glory may be thine
Of ending this great War, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such Virtue and Grace
Immense I have transfused, that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy Power above compare,
And this perverse Commotion governed thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels
That shake Heavens basis, bring forth all my War,
My Bow and Thunder, my Almighty Arms


Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
From all Heavens bounds into the utter Deep:
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
God and Messiah his anointed King.



He said, and on his Son with Rays direct
Shone full, he all his Father full expressed
Ineffably into his face received,
And thus the filial Godhood answering spake.



O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou always seeks
To glorify thy Son, I always thee
