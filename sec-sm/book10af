Vale on slime,
Huge Python, and his Power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain; they all
Him followed issuing forth to th'open Field,
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
heaven fallen, in station stood or just array,
Sublime with expectation when to see
ln Triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
And horrid sympathy; for what they saw,
They felt themselves now changing; down their arms,
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form
Caught by Contagion, like in punishment,
As in their crime.  Thus was th'applause they meant,
Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,
His will who reigns above, to aggravate
Their penance, laden with Fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve

Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining
For one forbidden Tree a multitude
Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;
Yet parcht with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,

But on they rolled in heaps, and up the Trees
Climbing, sat thicker then the snaky locks
That curled Meg??ra: greedily they plucked
The fruit fair to sight, like that which grew
Near that bituminous Lake where Sodom flamed;
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
Deceived; they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
Showed bitter Ashes, which th'offended taste
With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell
Into the same illusion, not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued
And worn with Famine, long and ceaseless hiss,
Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed,
Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days,
To dash their pride, and joy for Man seduced.
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got,
And Fabled how the Serpent, whom they called

Ophion with Eurynome, the wide-
Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven
And Ops, ere yet Dictaelig;an Jove was born.
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived, Sin there in power before,
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
Habitual habitant; behind her Death

Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began.



Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death,

What think thou of our Empire now, though earned
With travail difficult, not better far
Then still at Hells dark threshold to have sate watch,
Unnamed, untreated, and thy self half starved?



Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answered soon.

 To me, who with eternal Famine
pine,
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,
There best, where most with ravine I may meet;
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.



To whom th'incestuous Mother thus replied.
 Thou therefore on these Herbs, and
Fruits, and Flours
Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Foul,
No homely morsels, and whatever thing
The Sith of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,
Till I in Man residing through the Race,
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,
And season him thy last and sweetest prey.



This said, they both betook them several ways,
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
All kinds, and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later; which the almighty seeing,
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.



See with what heat these Dogs of Hell  advance
To waste and havoc yonder World, which I
So fair and good created, and had still
Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man
Let in these wistful Furies, who impute
Folly to me, so doth the Prince of Hell
And his Adherents, that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly, and conniving-seem
To gratify my scornful Enemies,

That laugh, as if transported with some fit
Of Passion, I to them had quited all,
At random yielded up to their misrule;
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure, till crammed and gorged, nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling
Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave
at  last
Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jaws.
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain:
Till then the Curse pronounced on both precedes.



He ended, and the heavenly Audience loud
Sung Halleluia, as the
