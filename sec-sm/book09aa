            Paradise Lost. BOOK IX
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Satan having compassed the Earth, with meditated guile
returns as  a mist by Night into Paradise, enters into the
Serpent sleeping. 
Adam and Eve in the Morning go forth to their
labours, which 
Eve proposes to divide in several places, each labouring
apart: 
Adam conscents not, alleging the danger, lest that Enemy,
 of whom they were forewarned, should attempt her found alone:  
Eve loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges 
her going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her 
strength; Adam at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone;
his  subtle aproach, first gazing, then speaking, with much  flattery
extolling Eve above all other Creatures. Eve
wondering to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he atcoined to  human
speech and such understanding not till now; the Serpent  answers, that
by tasting of a certain Tree in the Garden he  attained both to Speech
and Reason, till then void of each;  
Eve requires him  to bring her to that  Tree, and
finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden: The  Serpent now grow
bolder, with many wiles and arguments induces  her at length to eat; she
pleased with the taste deliberates a  while whether to impart thereof to
Adam or not, at last brings  him of the Fruit, relates what
persuaded her to eat thereof: 
Adam at first amazed, but persieving her lost, resolves 
through vehemence of love to perish with her; and extenuating the 
trespass eats also of the Fruit: The Effects thereof in them  both; they
seek to cover their nakedness; then fall to  variance and accusation
of one another.


NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar used
To sit indulgent, and with him partake
Rural repast, permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamed: I now must change
Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,
And disobedience: On the part of Heaven
Now alienated, distance and distaste,
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,
That brought into this World a world of woe,
Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
Not less but more Heroic then the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursued
Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd,
Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cytherea's Son;
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my Celestial Patroness, who deigns


Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
And dictates to me slumbering, or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated Verse:
Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
Pleased me long choosing, and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to entice
Wars, hitherto the only Argument
Heroic deemed, chief maistrie to dissect
With long and tedious havoc fabled Knights
In Battles feigned; the better fortitude
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture, emblazoned Shields,
Impress quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgeous Knights
At Joust and Torneament; then marshalled Feast
Served up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
Not that which justly gives Heroic name
To Person or to Poem.  Me of these
Nor skilled nor studious, higher Argument
Remains, sufficient of it self to raise
That name, unless an age too late, or cold
Climate, or Years damp my intended wing
Depressed, and much they may, if all be mine,
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.


The Sun was sunk, and after him the Star
Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
between Day and Night, and now from end to end
Nights Hemisphere had veiled the Horizon round:
When Satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved
In meditated fraud and malice, bent

On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, fearless returned.
By Night he fled, and at Midnight returned
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descried
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,
The space of seven continued Nights he rode
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
He circled, four times crossed the Carr of Night
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
On the eighth returned, and on the Coast averse
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wrought the change,
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise

Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
In with the River sunk, and with it rose
Satan involved in rising Mist, then sought
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searched and Land
From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole

M??otis, up beyond the River Obe;
Downward as far Antartic; and in length
West from Orontes to the Ocean barred
At Darien, thence to the Land where flows

Ganges and Induce: thus the Orb he roamed
With narrow search; and with inspection deep
Considered every Creature, which of all
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
The Serpent subtlest Beast of all the Field.
Him after long debate, irresolute
Of th
