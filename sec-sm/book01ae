with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
Nathless he so endured, till on the Beach
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and called
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay entranced
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strew the Brooks
In Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades
High overarched imbowr; or scattered sedge
Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves overthrew

Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry,
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
From the safe shore their floating Carcasses
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
Under amazement of their hideous change.
He called so loud, that all the hollow Deep
Of Hell resounded.  Princes,
Potentates,
Warriors, the Flower of Heaven, once yours, now lost,
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal spirits; or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of Battle to repose

Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror?  who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the Flood
With scattered Arms and Ensigns, till anon
His swift pursuers from Heaven Gates discern
The advantage, and descending tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulf.
Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen.





They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to their Generals Voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod
Of Amrams Son in Egypt evil day
Waved round the Coast, up called a pitchy cloud
Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,
That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night, and darkened all the Land of Nile:
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell
Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
Till, as a signal given, the uplifted Spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course, in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
A multitude, like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins, to pass

Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons

Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
The Heads and Leaders thither has where stood
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
Though of their Names in heavenly Records now
Be no memorial blotted out and rased
By their Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve

Got them new Names, till wandering ore the Earth,
Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man,
By falsities and lies the greatest part
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator, and the invisible
Glory of him that made them, to transform
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorned
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
And Devils to adore for Deities:
Then were they known to men by various Names,
And various Idols through the Heathen World.
Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,
Roused from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
At their great Emperors call, as next in worth
Came singly where he sto
