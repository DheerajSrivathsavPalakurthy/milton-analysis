vealed, which the invisible King,
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in Night,
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Enough is left besides to search and know.
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain,
Oppresses else with Surfeit, and soon turns
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Wind.


Know then, that after Lucifer from Heaven
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
Of Angels, then that Star the Stars among)
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
Into his place, and the great Son returned
Victorious with his Saints, The Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.



At least our envious Foe hath failed, who  thought
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength, the seat
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,
He trusted to have seized, and into fraud
Drew many, whom their place knows here no more;

Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,
Their station, Heaven yet populous retains
Number sufficient to possess her Realms
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
With Ministries due and solemn Rites:
But least his heart exalt him in the harm
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heaven
My damage fondly deemed, I can repair
That detriment, if such it be to lose
Self-lost, and in a moment will create
Another World, out of one man a Race
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
Not here, till by degrees of merit raised
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience tried,
And Earth be changed to Heaven, & Heaven to Earth,
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven,
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth,
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I uncircumscribed my self retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessity and Chance
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.



So spake the almighty, and to what he spake
His Word, the filial Godhood, gave effect.
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
Then time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,


So told as earthly notion can receive.
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
When such was heard declared the Almightie's will;
Glory they sung to the most High, good will
To future men, and in their dwellings peace:
Glory to him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out th'ungodly from his sight
And th'habitations of the just; to him
Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create, in stead
Of Spir
