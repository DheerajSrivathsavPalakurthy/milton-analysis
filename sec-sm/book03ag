ome small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
As when a Vulture on Imaus bred,
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
But in his way lights on the barren Plains
Of Sericana, where Chinese drive
With Sails and Wind their canie Waggons light:
So on this windy Sea of Land, the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey,
Alone, for other Creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none,
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like Aerial vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain, when Sin
With vanity had filled the works of men:
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of Glory or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or the other life;
All who have their reward on Earth, the fruits
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 

Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamt;
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the Angelical and Human kind:
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
First from the ancient World those Giants came
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
The builders next of Babel on the Plain
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
Others came single; he who to be deemed
A God, leaped fondly into ??tna flames,

Empedocles, and he who to enjoy

Plato's Elysium, leaped into the Sea,

Cleombrotus, and many more too long,
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friars
White, Black and Grey, with all their trumpery.
Here Pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixed,
And that Crystalline Sphere whose balance weighs
The Trepidation talked, and that first moved;
And now Saint Peter at Heavens Wicket seems
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their Feet, when lo
A violent cross wind from either Coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
Into the devious Air; then might ye see
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with their wearers tossed
And fluttered into Rags, then Relics, Beads, 

Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
The sport of Winds: all these appareled aloft
Fly o'er the backside of the World far off
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
Long after, now unpeopled, and untrod;
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passed,
And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
His travelled steps; far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
At top whereof, but far more rich appeared
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
With Frontispiece of Diamond and Gold
Embellished, th
