 ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 

To Heaven removed where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls o'er Elision Flours her Amber stream;
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks enwreathed with beams,
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shone
Inpurpled with Celestial Roses smiled.
Then Crowned again their golden Harps they took,
Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Pr??amble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.


Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shades
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his Glory abides,
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.

He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created, and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations: thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder did not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
Heavens everlasting Frame, while o'er the necks
Thou drove of warring Angels disarrayed.
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Fathers might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
Not so on Man; him through their malice fallen,
Father of Mercy and Grace, thou did not doom
So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
Of Mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
Regardless of the Bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee, offered himself to die
For mans offence.  O unexampled love,
Love no where to be found less then Divine!
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
Shall be the copious matter of my Song
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin.



Thus they in Heaven, above the starry Sphere,
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
Of this round World, whose first convex divides
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,

Satan alighted walks: a Globe far off
It seemed, now seems a boundless Continent 

Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
Starless exposed, and ever-threatning storms
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far s
