intervolv'd, yet regular
Then most, when most irregular they seem,
And in their motions harmony Divine
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
Listens delighted.  Evening now approached
(For wee have also our Evening and our Morn,
Wee ours for change delectable, not need)
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous; all in Circles as they stood,
Tables are set, and on a sudden piled
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massy Gold
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heaven.
On flours reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,
They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy, secure
Of surfeit where full measure only bounds
Excess, before the all bounteous King, who showered
With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. 

Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhaled
From that high mount of God, whence light & shade
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
In darker veil) and roseate Dews disposed
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
Wide over all the Plain, and wider far
Then all this globous Earth in Plain out spread,
(Such are the Courts of God) the Angelic throng
Dispersed in Bands and Files their Camp extend
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
Fannd with cool Winds, save those who in their course
Melodious Hymns about the soverign Throne
Alternate all night long: but not so waked

Satan, so call him now, his former name
Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
In favour and in pr??eminence, yet fraught
With envy against the Son of God, that day
Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed

Messiah King anointed, could not bear
Through pride that sight, & thought himself impaired.
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
Unworshipt, unobeyed the Throne supreme
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
Awning, thus to him in secret spake.





sleeps thou Companion dear, what sleep can close
Thy eye-lids: and remember what Decree 

Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips
Of Heavens Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts
Was wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
Both waking we were one; how then can now
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou see imposed;
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place
To utter is not safe. Assemble thou
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night
Her shadowy Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
And all who under me their Banners wave,
Homeward with flying march where we possess
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare
Fit entertainment to receive our King
The great Messiah, and his new commands,
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.



So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused
Bad influence into th'unwarie breast
Of his Associate; he together calls,
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heaven,
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
Or taint integrity; but all obeyed
The wonted signal, and superior voice
Of their great Potentate; for great indeed
His name, and high was his degree in Heaven; 

His countenance, as the Morning Star that guides
The starry flock, allured them, and with lies
Drew after him the third part of Heavens Host:
Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
And from within the golden Lamps that burn
Nightly before him, saw without their light
Rebellion rising, saw in w
