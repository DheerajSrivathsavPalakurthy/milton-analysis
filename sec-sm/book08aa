            Paradise Lost. BOOK VIII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Adam enquires concerning celestial Motions, is doubtfully
 answered, and exhorted to search rather things more worthy of 
knowledge: Adam assents, and still desirous to detain Raphael,
 relates to him what he remembered since his own Creation, his  placing
in Paradise, his talk with God  concerning solitude and
fit society, his first meeting and  Nuptials with Eve, his
discourse with the Angel thereupon; who  after admonitions repeated
departs.

THE Angel ended, and in Adams Ear
So Charming left his voice, that he a while
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied.

 What thanks sufficient, or what
recompense
Equal have I to render thee, Divine
Historian, who thus largely has allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge, and Vouchsafed

This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
With glory attributed to the high
Creator; something yet of doubt remains,
Which only thy solution can resolve.
When I behold this goodly Frame, this World
Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute,
Their magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a grain,
An Atom, with the Firmament compared
And all her numbered Stars, that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible (for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal) merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
One day and night; in all their vast survey
Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
So many nobler Bodies to create,
Greater so manifold to this one use,
For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,
That better might with far less compass move,
Served by more noble then her self, attains
Her end without least motion, and receives,
As Tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number fails. 


So spake our Sire, and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve

Perceiving where she sat retired in sight,
With lowliness Majestic from her seat,


And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,
Her Nursery; they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendency gladlier grew.
Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
Delighted, or not capable her ear
Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,

Adam relating, she sole Auditress;
Her Husband the Relater she preferred
Before the Angel, and of him to ask
Chose rather; he, she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions, and solve high d
