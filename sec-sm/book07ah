other whose gay Train
Adorns him, coloured with the Florid hue
Of Rainbows and Starry Eyes.  The Waters thus
With Fish replenished, and the Air with Foul,
Evening and Morn solemnised the Fifth day.


The Sixth, and of Creation last arose
With Evening Harps and Mitten, when God said,


 Let the Earth bring forth Foul
living in her kind,
Cattle and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
Each in their kind.   The Earth
obeyed, and strait
Opening her fertile Womb teemed at a Birth
numerous living Creatures, perfect forms,
Limbed and full grown: out of the ground up rose
As from his Lair the wilde Beast where he one
In Forest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walked:
The Cattle in the Fields and Meadows green:
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
The grassy Clods now Calv'd, now half appeared
The Tawny Lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
The Leopard, and the Tiger, as the Moil
Rising, the crumbled Earth above them threw
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head: scarce from his mould

Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
His vastness: Fleeced the Flocks and bleating rose,
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
The River Horse and scaly Crocodile.
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
Insect or Worm; those waved their limber fans
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
These as a line their long dimension drew,
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kind
Wondrous in length and corpulence involved
Their Snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept

The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
Of future, in small room large heart enclosed,
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter, joined in her popular Tribes
Of Commonalty: swarming next appeared
The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
With Honey stored: the rest are numberless,
And thou their Natures know, & gave them Names,
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen Eyes
And hairy Main terrific, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heaven in all her Glory shone, and rolled
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
First wheeled their course; Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled; Air, Water, Earth,
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walked
Frequent; and of the Sixth day yet remained;
There wanted yet the Master work, the end
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
And Brute as other Creatures, but endued
Wit
