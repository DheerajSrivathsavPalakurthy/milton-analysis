And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile Banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gained a King,

Ahaz his sottish Conqueror, whom he drew
Gods Altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offerings, and adore the Gods
Whom he had vanquished.  After these appeared
A crew who under Names of old Renown,

Osiris, Isis, Orus and their
 some copies have their  Train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek
Their wandering Gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather then human.  Nor did Israel escape
The infection when their borrowed Gold composed
The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,

Jehovah, who in one Night when he passed
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. 



Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
Or Altar smoked; yet who more oft then he
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God.
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
And in luxurious Cities, where the noise
Of riot ascends above their  some copies have  theirloftiest Towers,
And injury and outrage: And when Night
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
Exposed a Matron to avoid worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might;
The rest were long to tell, though far renowned,
The Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held
Gods, yet confessed later then Heaven and Earth
Their boasted Parents; Titan Heavens first born
With his enormous brood, and birthright seized
By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove

His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;
So Jove usurping reigned: these first in Create

And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle Air
Their highest Heaven; or on the Delphian Cliff,
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old
Fled over Atria to the Hesperian Fields,
And ore the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. 
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appeared

Obscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
Their fencing courage, and dispel'd their fears.
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claimed

Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurled
The Imperial Ensign, which full high advanced
Shone like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
With Gems and Golden lustre rich emblazed,
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
Sonorous mettle blowing Martial sounds:
At which the universal Host upsent
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
A Forest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
Appeared, and serried Shields in thick array
Of dep
