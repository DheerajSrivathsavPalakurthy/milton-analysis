t their ways; he oft
Frequented their Assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preached
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
In Prison under Judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
Contending, and removed his Tents far off;
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
Measured by Cubit, length, and breadth, and height,
Smeared round with Pitch, and in the side a door
Contrived, and of provisions laid in large
For Man and Beast: when lo a wonder strange1
Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
Came sevens, and pairs, and entered in, as taught
Their order: last the Sire, and his three Sons
With their four Wives; and God made fast the door.
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
From under Heaven; the Hills to their supply
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
Sent up amain; and now the thickened Sky
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rushed the Rain
Impetuous, and continued till the Earth
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting o'er the Waves, all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
Deep under water rolled; Sea covered Sea,
Sea without shore; and in their Palaces
Where luxury late reigned, Sea-monsters whelped
And stabled; of Mankind, so numerous late,

All left, in one small bottom swum embarked.
How did thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
The end of all thy Offspring, end so sad,
Depopulation; thee another Flood,
Of tears and sorrow a Flood thee also drowned,
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reared
By th'Angel, on thy feet thou stood at last,
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
His Children, all in view destroyed at once;
And scarce to th'Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.



O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
Lived ignorant of future, so had borne
My part of evil only, each days lot
Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed
The burden of many Ages, on me light
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
Abortive, to torment me ere their being,
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
Him or his Children, evil he may be sure,
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
And he the future evil shall no less
In apprehension then in substance feel
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped
Famine and anguish will at last consume
Wandering that watery Desert: I had hope
When violence was ceased, and War on Earth,
All would have then gon well, peace would have crowned
With length of happy days the race of man;
But I was far deceived; for now I see
Peace to corrupt no less then War to waste.
How comes it thus? unfold, Celestial Guide,
And whether here the Race of man will end.



 To whom thus Michael.
 Those whom last thou saw
In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
First seen in acts of prowess eminent
And great exploits, but of true virtue void;
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
Subduing Nations, and achieved thereby
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
Surfeit, and lust, till wantonness and pride
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in Peace.
The conquered also, and enslaved by War
Shall with their freedom lost all virtue loose
And fear of God, from whom their piety feigned
In sharp contest of Battle found no aide
Against invaders; therefore cooled in zeal
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
Worldly or dissolute, on what their Lords
Shall leave them to enjoy; for the Earth shall bear
More then enough, that temperance may be tried:
So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved,
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
One Man except, the only Son of light
In a dark Age, against example good,
Against allurements, custom, and a World
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
Or
