            Paradise Lost. Book VI.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Raphael continues to relate how Michael and
Gabriel were  sent forth to battle against Satan and
his Angels.  The  first Fight described: Satan and his
Powers retire under  Night: He calls a Council, invents devilish
Engines, which in the  second days Fight put Michael and his
Angels to some disorder;   but they at length pulling up Mountains
overwhelmed both the  force and Machins of Satan: Yet the
Tumult not so ending, God  on the third day sends Messiah his
Son, for whom he had  reserved the glory of that Victory: He in the
Power of his  Father coming to the place, and causing all his Legions to
stand  still on either side, with his Chariot and Thunder driving into 
the midst of his Enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards  the
wall of Heaven;  which opening, they leap down with horror  and
confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in  the Deep:
Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.



ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursued
Through Heavens wide Champagne held his way, till Morn,
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
Unbarred the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven, arrayed in Gold
Imperial, from before her vanished Night,
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
Coverd with thick embattled Squadrons bright,
Chariots and flaming Arms, and fiery Steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct, and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly Powers who him received
With joy and acclamation loud, that one
That of so many Myriads fallen, yet one
Returned not lost: On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice
From midst a Golden Cloud thus mild was heard.



Servant of God, well done, well has thou  fought
The better fight, who single has maintained
Against revolted multitudes the Cause
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Arms;
And for the testimony of Truth has born    


Universal reproach, far worse to bear
Then violence: for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God, though Worlds
Judged thee perverse: the easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Then scorned thou did depart, and to subdue
By force, who reason for their Law refuse,
Right reason for their Law, and for their King

Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns.
Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince,
And thou in Military prowess next

Gabriel, lead forth to Battle these my Sons
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
By Thousands and by Millions ranged for fight;
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
Into their place of punishment, the Gulf
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.



So spake the Soverign voice, and Clouds began
To darken all the Hill, and smoke to roll
In dusky wreathes, reluctant flames, the sign
Of wrath awaked: nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal Trumpet from on high began blow:
At which command the Powers Militant,
That stood for Heaven, in mighty Quadrate join"d
Of Union irresistible, moved on
In silence their bright Legions, to the sound
Of instrumental Harmony that breathed
Heroic Ardor to adventurous deeds
Under their God-like Leaders, in the Cause

Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
Indissoluble firm; nor obvious Hill,
Nor straitening Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream d
