its malign a better Race to bring
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
On his great Expedition now appeared,
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine, Sapience and Love
Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
About his Chariot numberless were poured
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
And Virtues, winged Spirits, and Chariots winged,
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodged
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
The King of Glory in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore
They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,

Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Heavens height, and with the Center mix the Pole.



Silence, ye troubled waves, and thou Deep, peace,

 Said then th'Omnific Word,
 your  discord end:

 Nor staid, but on the Wings of
Cherubim
Uplifted, in Paternal Glory rode
Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;
For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Train
Followed in bright procession to behold
Creation, and the wonders of his might.
Then staid the fervid Wheels, and in his hand
He took the golden Compasses, prepared
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
This Universe, and all created things:
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure,
And said,  thus far extend, thus
far thy bounds,
This be thy just Circumference, O World.

 Thus God the Heaven created, thus
the Earth,
Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound
Covered th'Abyss: but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purged
The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
Like things to like, the rest to several place
Disported, and between spun out the Air,
And Earth self balanced on her Center hung.



Let there be Light,  said God,
and  forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
To journey through the airy gloom began,


Sphered in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
Was not; she in a cloudy Tabernacle
Sojourned the while.  God saw the Light was good;
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
He named.  Thus was the first Day Even and Morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the Celestial Quires,
