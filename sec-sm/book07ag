sser Lights dividual holds,

With thousand thousand Stars, that then appeared
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adorned
With their bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
Glad Evening and glad Morn crowned the fourth day.


And God said,  let the Waters
generate
Reptile with Spawn abundant, living Soul:
And let Foul fly above the Earth, with wings
Displayed on the open Firmament of Heaven.

 And God created the great Whales,
and each
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
The waters generated by their kinds,
And every Bird of wing after his kind;
And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and in the
Seas
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
And let the Foul be multiplied on the Earth.

 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas,
each Creek and Bay
With Fry innumerable swarm, and Shoals
Of Fish that with their Finns and shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculls that oft
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
Graze the Sea weed their pasture, and through Groves
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
Show to the Sun their waved coats dropped with Gold,
Or in their Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks their food
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seal,
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their Gate
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
Stretched like a Promontory sleeps or swims,
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gills
Draws in, and at his Trunk spouts out a Sea.

Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shores
Their Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
Their callow young, but feathered soon and fledge
They summed their Pens, and soaring the air sublime
With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
On Cliffs and Cedar tops their Eyries build:
Part loosely wing the Region, part more wise
In common, ranged in figure wedge their way,
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
Their Aerie Caravan high over Sea's
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
Easing their flight; so steers the prudent Crane
Her annual Voyage, born on Winds; the Air
Floats, as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
Solaced the Woods, and spread their painted wings
Till Even, nor then the solemn Nightingale
Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays:
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bathed
Their downy Breast; the Swan with Arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rows
Her state with Oar feet: yet oft they quit
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, tower
The mid Aerial Sky: Others on ground
Walked firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours, and the
