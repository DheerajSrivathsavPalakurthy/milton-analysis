h Sanctity of Reason, might erect
His Stature, and upright with Front serene
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in Devotion, to adore
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father (For where is not he
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.


 Let us make now Man in our image, Man
In our similitude, and let them rule
Over the Fish and Foul of Sea and Air,
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
 This said, he formed thee, Adam,
thee O Man
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of Life; in his own Image he
Created thee, in the Image of God
Express, and thou became a living Soul.
Male he created thee, but thy consort
Female for Race; then blessed Mankind, and said,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and fill
the Earth,
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
Over Fish of the Sea, and Foul of the Air,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.

 Wherever thus created, for no
place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste;
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
Variety without end; but of the Tree
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
Thou may not; in the day thou eats, thou did;
Death is the penalty imposed, beware,
And govern well thy appetite, least sin
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
Here finished he, and all that he had made
Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
So Even and Morn accomplished the Sixth day:
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned

Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode,
Thence to behold this new created World
Th'addition of his Empire, how it showed
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how fair,
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand Harps that tuned
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Air
Resounded, (thou remember, for thou heard)
The Heavens and all the Constellations rung,
The Planets in their station listening stood,
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

 Open, ye everlasting Gates,
 they  sung,

 Open, ye Heavens, your living
doors; let in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged Messengers
On errands of supernal Grace.   So
sung
The glorious Train ascendi
