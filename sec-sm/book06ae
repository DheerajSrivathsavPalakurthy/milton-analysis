llect, all Sense, and as they please,
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.


Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
And with fierce Ensigns pierced the deep array
Of Moloc furious King, who him defied,
And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
Down cloven to the waste, with shattered Arms
And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing

Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armed,
Vanquished Adramelec, and Asmadai,
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
Mangled with ghastly wounds through Plate and Mail,
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
The Atheist crew, but with redoubled blow

Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew.
I might relate of thousands, and their names

Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
In might though wondrous and in Acts of War,
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doom
Concealed from Heaven and sacred memory,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
And ignominy, yet to glory aspires
Vain glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
Therefore Eternal silence be their doom.


And now their Mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
With many an inrode gored; deformed rout
Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiverd armour strewn, and on a heap
Chariot and Charioteer lay overturn
And fiery foaming Steeds; what stood, recoiled
Overwearied, through the faint Satanic Host
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience, till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or pain.
Far otherwise th'inviolable Saints
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanced entire,
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed:
Such high advantages their innocence
Gave them above their foes, not to have send,
Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
By wound, though from their place by violence moved.


Now Night her course began, and over Heaven
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,

And silence on the odious din of War:
Under her Cloudy covert both retired,
Victor and Vanquished: on the foughten field

Michael and his Angels prevalent
Encamping, placed in Guard their Watches round,
Cherubic waving fires: on the other part

Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
Far in the dark dislodged, and void of rest,
His Potentates to Council called by night;
And in the midst thus undismayed began.



O now in danger tried, now known in Arms
Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,
Found worthy not of Liberty alone,
Too mean pretence, but what we more affect,
Honour, Dominion, Glory, and renown,
Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight
(And if one day, why not Eternal days?)
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his Throne, and judged
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,
Some disadvantage we endured and pain,
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
Since now we find this our Imperial form
Incapable of mortal injury
Imperishable, and though pierced with wound,
Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
Of evil then so small as easy think
The remedy; perhaps more valid Arms,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
Or equal what between us made the odds,

In Nature none: if other hidden cause
Left them Superior, while we can preserve
Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,
Due search and consultation will disclose.
