to the deep:
So wondrously was set his Station bright.
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the Sun's legend Orb
Through his glazed Optic Tube yet never saw.
The place he found beyond expression bright,
Compared with aught on Earth, Medal
Not all parts like, but all alike informed 

With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
If mettle, part seemed Gold, part Silver clear;
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
Ruby or Topaz, to the Twelve that shone
In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft then elsewhere seen,
That stone, or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
In vain, though by their powerful Art they bind
Volatile Harms, and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea,
Drained through a Limbec to his Native form.
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run
Potable Gold, when with one virtuous touch
The Arch-chimic Sun so far from us remote
Produces with Terrestrial Humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled, far and wide his eye commands,
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
Culminate from the ??quator, as they now
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Air,
No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far, whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
The same whom John saw also in the Sun:
His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
Of beaming sunny Rays, a golden tiar
Circled his Head, nor less his Locks behind
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings 

Lay waving round; on some great charge employed
He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandering flight
To Paradise the happy seat of Man,
His journeys end and our beginning woe.
But first he casts to change his proper shape,
Which else might work him danger or delay:
And now a stripling Cherub he appears,
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
Youth smiled Celestial, and to every Limb
Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned;
Under a Coronet his flowing hair
In curls on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with Gold,
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,
Admonished by his ear, and strait was known
The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven
Who in Gods presence, nearest to his Throne
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
O'er Sea and Land: him Satan thus accosts;




Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,
The first art wont his great authentic will
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,
Where all his Sons thy Embassy attend;
And here art likeliest by supreme decree
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye
To visit oft this new Creation round; 


Unspeakable desire to see, and know
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,
His chief delight and favour, him for whom
All these his works so wondr
