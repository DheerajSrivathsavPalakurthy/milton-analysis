n all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Ministering Spirits, trained up in Feast and Song;
Such has thou armed, the Minstrelsy of Heaven,
Servility with freedom to contend,


As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.



To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.

 Apostate, still thou erst, nor end
wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depraves it with the name
Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthralled;
Yet lewdly dare our ministering upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let me serve
In Heaven God ever blessed, and his Divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed,
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
From me returned, as erst thou said, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

 So saying, a noble stroke he
lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
His massy Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had pushed a Mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seized
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
Thus foiled their mightiest, ours joy filled, and shout,
Presage of Victory and fierce desire
Of Battle: whereat Michael bid sound
The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven

It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung

Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joined
The horrid shock: now storming fury rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing brayed
Horrible discord, and the matting Wheels
Of brazen Chariots raged; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming voles flew,
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
So under fiery Cope together rushed
Both Battles maine, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage; all Heaven
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These Elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their Regions: how much more of Power
Army against Army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, their happy Native seat;
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heaven high over-ruled
And limited their might; though numbered such
As each divided Legion might have seemed
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemed
Each Warrior single as in Chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of Battle, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim War; no thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed

That argued fear; each on himself relied,
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory; deeds of eternal fame
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spread
That War and various; sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemed then
Conflicting Fire: long time in even scale
The Battle hung; till Satan, who that day
Prodigious power had shown, and met in Arms
No equal, ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and felled
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and opposed the rocky Orb
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
A vast circumference: At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
Surceased, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine War
