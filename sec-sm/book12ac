d,
As to forsake the living God, and fall
To worship their own work in Wood and Stone
For Gods! yet him God the most High vouchsafed
To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
Which he will show him, and from him will raise
A mighty Nation, and upon him shower
His benediction so, that in his Seed
All Nations shall be blessed; he straight obeys,
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
I see him, but thou can not, with what Faith
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soil

Ur of Chald??a, passing now the Ford

To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth
With God, who called him, in a land unknown.

Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents
Pitched about Sachem, and the neighbouring Plain
Of Moreh; there by promise he receives
Gift to his Progeny of all that Land;
From Hamath Northward to the Desert South
(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed)
From Hormone East to the great Western Sea,
Mount Hormone, yonder Sea, each place behold
In prospect, as I point them; on the shore
Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream

Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills.
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be reveled.  This Patriarch blessed,
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
The Grandchild with twelve Sons increased, departs
From Canaan, to a Land hereafter called

Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
He comes invited by a younger Son
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that Realm
Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race

Growing into a Nation, and now grown
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably, and kills their infant Males:
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call

Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim
His people from enthralling, they return
With glory and spoil back to their promised Land.
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
To know their God, or message to regard,
Must be compelled by Signs and Judgements dire;
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turned,
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;
His Cattle must of Rot and Murren die,
Botches and blaines must all his flesh emboss,
And all his people; Thunder mixed with Hail,
Hail mixed with fire must rend theEgyptian Sky
And wheel on the Earth, devouring whe
