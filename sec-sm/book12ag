ight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.



To whom thus Michael.
 Dream  not of their fight,
As of a Duel, or the local wounds
Of head or heel: not therefore joins the Son
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
Thy enemy; nor so is overcome

Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,
Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound:
Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recur,
Not by destroying Satan, but his works

In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
But by fulfilling that which thou did want,
Obedience to the Law of God, imposed
On penalty of death, and suffering death,
The penalty to thy transgression due,
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
So only can high Justice rest appaid.
The Law of God exact he shall fulfil
Both by obedience and by love, though love
Alone fulfil the Law; thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death,
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
In his redemption, and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
To save them, not their own, though legal works.
For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,
Seized on by force, judged, and to death condemned
A shameful and accursed, nailed to the Cross
By his own Nation, slain for bringing Life;
But to the Cross he nails thy Enemies,
The Law that is against thee, and the sins
Of all mankind, with him there crucified,
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
But soon revives, Death over him no power
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
Return, the Stars of Morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
His death for Man, as many as offered Life
Neglect not, and the benefit embrace
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act


Annuls thy doom, the death thou should have died,
In sin for ever lost from life; this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine arms,
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on Earth then certain times to appear
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his Salvation, them who shall believe
Baptising in the profluent stream, the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
For death, like that which the redeemer died.
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
Not only to the Sons of Abrahams Loins
Salvation shall be Preached, but to the Sons
Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;
So in his seed all Nations shall be blessed.
Then to th
