            Paradise Lost. Book III.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            God sitting on his Throne sees Satan flying towards this
world,  then newly created; shows him to the Son who sat at his right 
hand; foretells the success of Satan in perverting mankind; 
clears his own Justice and Wisdom from all imputation, having  created
Man free and able enough to have withstood his  Templa; yet
declares his purpose of grace towards him, in  regard he fell not of his
own malice; as did Satan, but by him  seduced.  The Son of God
renders praises to his Father for the  manifestation of his gracious purpose
towards Man; but God  again declares, that Grace cannot be extended
towards Man without  the satisfaction of divine Justice; Man hath
offended the majesty  of God by aspiring to God-head, and therefore
with all his  Progeny devoted to death must dye, unless some one can be
found  sufficient to answer for his offence, and undergo his Punishment.
  The Son of God freely offers himself a Ransom for Man: the 
 Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation,  pronounces
his exaltation above all Names in Heaven and  Earth; commands all the
Angels to adore him; they obey, and  hymning to their Harps in full
Quire, celebrate the Father and the  Son.  Mean while  Satan
alights upon the bare Convex of  this Worlds outermost Orb; where
wandering he first finds a  place since called The Lymbo of Vanity; what
persons and things  fly up thither; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven,
described  ascending by stairs, and the waters above the Firmament
 that flow about it: His passage thence to the Orb of the Sun; he  finds
there Uriel the Regient of that Orb, but first changes 
himself into the shape of a meaner Angel; and pretending a  zealous
desire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had  placed here,
enquires of him the place of his habitation, and is  directed; alights
first on Mount
Niphates.


HAil holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born,
Or of the Eternal Coeternal beam
May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from Eternity, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
Or hear thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
Before the Heavens thou were, and at the voice
Of God, as with a Mantle did invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
Escaped the Stygian Pool, though long detained 

In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes then to the Orphean Lyre
I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy soverign vital Lamp; but thou
Revisits not these eyes, that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
So thick a drop serene hath quenched their Orbs,
Or dim suffusion veiled.  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear Spring, or shady Grove, or Sunny Hill,
Smite with the love of sacred Song; but chief
Thee Zion and the flowery Brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
Those other two equalled with me in Fate,
So were I equalled with them in renown,
Blind Thamyris and blind M??onides,
And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old.
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year
Seasons return, but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of Even or Morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off, and for the Book of knowledge fair
Presented with a Universal blanc 

Of Natures works to me expunged and rased,
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
So much the rather thou Celestial light
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight.


Now had the Almighty Father from above,
From the pure Empyrean where he sits
High Throned above all height, bent down his eye,
His own works and their works at once to view:
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as Stars, and from his sight received
Beatitude past utterance; on his right
The radiant image of his Glory sat,
His only Son; On Earth he first beheld
Our two first Parents, yet the only two
Of mankind, in the happy Garden placed,
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
Uninterrupted joy, unrivaled love
In blissful solitude; he then surveyed
Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet
On the bare outside of this World, that seemed
Firm land bosomed without Firmament,
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.
Him God beholding from his prospect high,
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.



Only begotten Son, see thou what rage
Transports our adversary, whom no bounds
Prescribed, no bars of Hell, nor all the chains 

Heaped on him there, nor yet the main Abyss
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems
On desperate revenge, that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven, in the Precincts of light,
Directly towards the new created World,
And Man there placed, with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy, or worse,
By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert
For man will harken to his glozing lies,
And easily transgress the sole Command,
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall,
He and his faithless Progeny: whose fault?
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me
All he could have; I made him just and right,
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
Such I created all the Ethereal Powers
And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed;
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
Not free, what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,
Where only what they needs must do, appeared,
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled,
Made passive both, had served necessity,
Not me.  They therefore as to right belongs,
So were created, nor can justly accuse
Their maker, or their making, or their Fate,
As if predestination over-ruled
Their will, disposed by absolute Decree
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed 


Their own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,
Or aught by me immutably foreseen,
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so
I formed them free, and free they must remain,
Till they enthral themselves: I else must change
Their nature, and revoke the high Decree
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordained
Their freedom, they themselves ordained their fall.
The first sort by their own suggestion fell,
Self-tempted, self-depraved: Man falls deceived
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,
Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel,
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.



Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance filled
All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect
Sense of new joy ineffable diffused:
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious, in him all his Father shone
Substantially expressed, and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appeared,
Love without end, and without measure Grace,
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.



O Father, gracious was that word which closed
Thy soverign sentence, that Man should find grace;
For which both Heaven and Earth shall high extol
Thy praises, with the innumerable sound
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, where to thy Throne
Encompassed shall resound thee ever blessed.
For should Man finally be lost, should Man 

Thy creature late so loved, thy youngest Son
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joined
With his own folly? that be from thee far,
That far be from thee, Father, who art Judge
Of all things made, and judge only right.
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfil
His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,
Or proud return though to his heavier doom,
Yet with revenge accomplished and to Hell
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,
For him, what for thy glory thou has made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be questioned and blasphemed without defence.



To whom the great Creator thus replied.

 O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief
delight,
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
All has thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:
Man shall not quite be lost, but saved who will,
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
Freely vouchsafed; once more I will renew
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthralled
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe,
By me upheld, that he may know how frail
His fallen condition is, and to me ow
All his deliverance, and to none but me.
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest; so is my will: 

The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warned
Their sinful state, and to appease betimes
The incensed Deity, while offered grace
Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,
What may suffice, and soften stony hearts
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
Though but endeavoured with sincere intent,
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
And I will place within them as a guide
My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear,
Light after light well used they shall attain,
And to the end persisting, safe arrive.
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
But hard be hardened, blind be blinded more,
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
And none but such from mercy I exclude.
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,
Disloyal breaks his fealty, and sins
Against the high Supremacy of Heaven,
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,
To expiate his Treason hath nought left,
But to destruction sacred and devote,
He with his whole posterity must dye,
Dye he or Justice must; unless for him
Some other able, and as willing, pay
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
Say Heavenly powers, where shall we find such love,
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem
Mans mortal crime, and just the unjust to save,
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?



He asked, but all the Heavenly Quire stood mute,
And silence was in Heaven: on mans behalf 


Patron or Intercessor none appeared,
Much less that dared upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have bin lost, adjudged to Death and Hell
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
In whom the fullness dwells of love divine,
His dearest mediation thus renewed.



Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
The speediest of thy winged messengers,
To visit all thy creatures, and to all
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought,
Happy for man, so coming; he her aide
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;
Atonement for himself or offering meet,
Indebted and undone, hath none to bring:
Behold me then, me for him, life for life
I offer, on me let thine anger fall;
Account me man; I for his sake will leave
Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee
Freely put off, and for him lastly dye
Well pleased, on me let Death wreck all his rage;
Under his gloomy power I shall not long
Lie vanquished; thou has given me to possess
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,
Though now to Death I yield, and am his due
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soul
For ever with corruption there to dwell;
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue
My vanquisher, spoiled of his vented spoil;
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop
Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed. 


I through the ample Air in Triumph high
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight
Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
While by thee raised I ruin all my Foes,
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:
Then with the multitude of my redeemed
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and return,
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
Of anger shall remain, but peace assured,
And reconciling; wrath shall be no more
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.



His words here ended, but his meek aspect
Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love
To mortal men, above which only shone
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
Glad to be offered, he attends the will
Of his great Father.  Admiration seized
All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend
Wondering; but soon the Almighty thus replied:



O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou
My sole complacence! well thou know how dear,
To me are all my works, nor Man the least
Though last created, that for him I spare
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.
Thou therefore whom thou only can redeem,
Their Nature also to thy Nature join;
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,
By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room
The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son.
As in him perish all men, so in thee 

As from a second root shall be restored,
As many as are restored, without thee none.
His crime makes guilty all his Sons, thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,
Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,
And dying rise, and rising with him raise
His Brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.
So Heavenly love shall outdo Hellish hate
Giving to death, and dying to redeem,
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate
So easily destroyed, and still destroys
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Mans Nature, lesson or degrade thine own.
Because thou has, though Throned in highest bliss
Equal to God, and equally enjoying
God-like fruition, quited all to save
A World from utter loss, and has been found
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,
Far more then Great or High; because in thee
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
Anointed universal King, all Power
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supreme
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide 


In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;
When thou attended gloriously from Heaven
Shalt in the Sky appear, and from thee send
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Winds
The living, and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past Ages to the general Doom
Shall hasten, such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
Then all thy Saints assembled, thou shalt judge
Bad men and Angels, they arraigned shall sink
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring
New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,
And after all their tribulations long
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.
Then thou thy regal Sceptre shalt lay by,
For regal Sceptre then no more shall need,
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,
Adore him, who to compass all this dies,
Adore the Son, and honour him as me.



No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
As from blessed voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung
With Jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled
The eternal Regions: lowly reverent
Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 

To Heaven removed where first it grew, there grows,
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls o'er Elision Flours her Amber stream;
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks enwreathed with beams,
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shone
Inpurpled with Celestial Roses smiled.
Then Crowned again their golden Harps they took,
Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Pr??amble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.


Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shades
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his Glory abides,
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.

He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created, and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations: thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder did not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
Heavens everlasting Frame, while o'er the necks
Thou drove of warring Angels disarrayed.
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Fathers might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
Not so on Man; him through their malice fallen,
Father of Mercy and Grace, thou did not doom
So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
Of Mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
Regardless of the Bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee, offered himself to die
For mans offence.  O unexampled love,
Love no where to be found less then Divine!
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
Shall be the copious matter of my Song
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin.



Thus they in Heaven, above the starry Sphere,
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
Of this round World, whose first convex divides
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,

Satan alighted walks: a Globe far off
It seemed, now seems a boundless Continent 

Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
Starless exposed, and ever-threatning storms
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far some small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
As when a Vulture on Imaus bred,
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
But in his way lights on the barren Plains
Of Sericana, where Chinese drive
With Sails and Wind their canie Waggons light:
So on this windy Sea of Land, the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey,
Alone, for other Creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none,
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like Aerial vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain, when Sin
With vanity had filled the works of men:
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of Glory or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or the other life;
All who have their reward on Earth, the fruits
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 

Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamt;
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the Angelical and Human kind:
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
First from the ancient World those Giants came
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
The builders next of Babel on the Plain
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
Others came single; he who to be deemed
A God, leaped fondly into ??tna flames,

Empedocles, and he who to enjoy

Plato's Elysium, leaped into the Sea,

Cleombrotus, and many more too long,
Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friars
White, Black and Grey, with all their trumpery.
Here Pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixed,
And that Crystalline Sphere whose balance weighs
The Trepidation talked, and that first moved;
And now Saint Peter at Heavens Wicket seems
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their Feet, when lo
A violent cross wind from either Coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
Into the devious Air; then might ye see
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with their wearers tossed
And fluttered into Rags, then Relics, Beads, 

Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
The sport of Winds: all these appareled aloft
Fly o'er the backside of the World far off
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
Long after, now unpeopled, and untrod;
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passed,
And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
His travelled steps; far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
At top whereof, but far more rich appeared
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
With Frontispiece of Diamond and Gold
Embellished, thick with sparkling orient Gems
The Portal shone, inimitable on Earth
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
Dreaming by night under the open Sky,
And waking cried, This is the Gate of Heaven

Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flowed
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearl, whereon
Who after came from Earth, sailing arrived,
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the Lake
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of Bliss. 

Direct against which opened from beneath,
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,
A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,
Wider by far then that of after-times
Over Mount Zion, and, though that were large,
Over the Promised Land to God so dear,
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
On high behests his Angels to and fro
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land

Borders on ??gypped and the Arabian shore;
So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.

Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of Gold to Heaven Gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First-seen, or some renowned Metropolis
With glistening Spires and Pinnacles adorned,
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized
At sight of all this World beheld so fair.
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
So high above the circling Canopy
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
Of Libra to the fleecy Star that bears

Andromeda far off Atlantic Seas 

Beyond the Horizon; then from Pole to Pole
He views in breadth, and without longer pause
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
His flight precipitant, and winds with ease
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable Stars, that shone
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other Worlds,
Or other Worlds they seemed, or happy Isles,
Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flowery Vales,
Thrice happy Isles, but who dwelt happy there
He stayed not to enquire: above them all
The golden Sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye: Thither his course he bends
Through the calm Firmament; but up or down
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
Or Longitude, where the great Luminary
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses Light from far; they as they move
Their Starry dance in numbers that compute
Days, months, &years, towards his all-cheering Lamp
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
The Universe, and to each inward part
With gentle penetration, though unseen,
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep:
So wondrously was set his Station bright.
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the Sun's legend Orb
Through his glazed Optic Tube yet never saw.
The place he found beyond expression bright,
Compared with aught on Earth, Medal
Not all parts like, but all alike informed 

With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
If mettle, part seemed Gold, part Silver clear;
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
Ruby or Topaz, to the Twelve that shone
In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft then elsewhere seen,
That stone, or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
In vain, though by their powerful Art they bind
Volatile Harms, and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea,
Drained through a Limbec to his Native form.
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run
Potable Gold, when with one virtuous touch
The Arch-chimic Sun so far from us remote
Produces with Terrestrial Humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled, far and wide his eye commands,
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
Culminate from the ??quator, as they now
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Air,
No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far, whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
The same whom John saw also in the Sun:
His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
Of beaming sunny Rays, a golden tiar
Circled his Head, nor less his Locks behind
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings 

Lay waving round; on some great charge employed
He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandering flight
To Paradise the happy seat of Man,
His journeys end and our beginning woe.
But first he casts to change his proper shape,
Which else might work him danger or delay:
And now a stripling Cherub he appears,
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
Youth smiled Celestial, and to every Limb
Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned;
Under a Coronet his flowing hair
In curls on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with Gold,
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,
Admonished by his ear, and strait was known
The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven
Who in Gods presence, nearest to his Throne
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
O'er Sea and Land: him Satan thus accosts;




Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,
The first art wont his great authentic will
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,
Where all his Sons thy Embassy attend;
And here art likeliest by supreme decree
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye
To visit oft this new Creation round; 


Unspeakable desire to see, and know
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,
His chief delight and favour, him for whom
All these his works so wondrous he ordained,
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandering.  Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining Orbs hath Man
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
But all these shining Orbs his choice to dwell;
That I may find him, and with secret gaze,
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;
That both in him and all things, as is meet,
The Universal Maker we may praise;
Who justly hath driven out his Rebel Foes
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss
Created this new happy Race of Men
To serve him better: wise are all his ways.



So spake the false dissembler unperceived;
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
Invisible, except to God alone,
By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
At wisdom's Gate, and to simplicity
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled

Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foul
In his uprightness answer thus returned.

 Fair Angel, thy desire which tends
to know
The works of God, thereby to glorify 

The great workmaster, leads to no excess
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
From thy Imperial Mansion thus alone,
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report hear only in heaven:
For wonderful indeed are all his works,
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance always with delight;
But what created mind can comprehend
Their number, or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep.
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,
This worlds material mould, came to a heap:

Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar
Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;
Till at his second bidding darkness fled,
Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:
Swift to their several Quarters hasted then
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Air, Fire,
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heaven
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
That rolled orbicular, and turned to Stars
Numberless, as thou see, and how they move;
Each had his place appointed, each his course,
The rest in circuit walls this Universe.
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light
His day, which else as the other Hemisphere
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon
(So call that opposite fair Star) her aide
Timely interposes, and her monthly round
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven; 


With borrowed light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,
And in her pale dominion checks the night.
That spot to which I point is Paradise,

Adams abode, those lofty shades his Bower.
Thy way thou can not miss, me mine requires.



Thus said, he turned, and Satan bowing low,
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,
Down from the Ecliptic, sped with hoped success,
Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheel,
Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.
