            Paradise Lost. BOOK VII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Raphael at the request of Adam relates how and
wherefore  this  world was first created; that God, after the 
expelling  of 
Satan and his Angels out of Heaven, declar'd his 
pleasure  to  create  another World and other Creatures to  dwell 
therein;  sends his Son with Glory and attendance of Angels to perform 
the  work  of Creation in six days: the Angels celebrate  with  Hymns 
the performance thereof, and his resignation into Heaven.


DEscend from Heaven Urania, by that
name
If rightly thou art called, whose Voice divine
Following, above theOlympian Hill I soar,
Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heavenly borne,
Before the Hills appeared, or Fountain flowed,

Thou with Eternal wisdom did converse,
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her did play
In presence of the almighty Father, pleased
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
An Earthly Guest, and drawn Imperial Air,
Thy tampering; with like safety guided down
Return me to my Native Element:
Least from this flying Steed unreingned, (as once

Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime)
Dismounted, on theAleian Field I fall
Erroneous there to wander and forlorn.
Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
Within the visible Diurnal Sphere;
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchanged
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,

Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race
Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard
In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Ears
To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
For thou are Heavenly, she an empty dream.


Say Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,
The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned

Adam by dire example to beware 

Apostasy, by what befell in Heaven
To those Apostates, least the like befall
In Paradise to Adam or his Race,
Charged not to touch the interdicted Tree,
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
So easily obeyed amid the choice
Of all tastes else to please their appetite,
Though wandering.  He with his consorted Eve

The story heard attentive, and was filled
With admiration, and deep Muse to hear
Of things so high and strange, things to their thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heaven,
And War so near the Peace of God in bliss
With such confusion: but the evil soon
Driven back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
With Blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed
The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
Led on, yet sunless, with desire to know
What nearer might concern him, how this World
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began,
When, and whereof created, for what cause,
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory, as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
Proceeded thus to ask his Heavenly Guest.



Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,
Far differing from this World, thou has revealed
Divine interpreter, by favour sent
Down from the Empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach:
For which to the infinitely Good we owe

Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his soverign will, the end
Of what we are.  But since thou has Vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concerned
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known,
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high, with moving Fires adorned
Innumerable, and this which yields or fills
All space, the ambient Air wide interfus'd
Embracing round this florid Earth, what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy Rest
Through all Eternity so late to build
In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon
Absolved, if unforbid thou may unfold
What wee, not to explore the secrets ask
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more
To magnify his works, the more we know.
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
Much of his Race though steep, suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His Generation, and the rising Birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the Star of Evening and the Moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring
Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch,
Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song
End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.



Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought:


And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.



 This also thy request with
caution asked
Obtain: though to recount Almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou can attain, which best may serve
To glorify the Maker, and infer
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing, such Commission from above
I have received, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in Night,
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Enough is left besides to search and know.
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
In measure what the mind may well contain,
Oppresses else with Surfeit, and soon turns
Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Wind.


Know then, that after Lucifer from Heaven
(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
Of Angels, then that Star the Stars among)
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
Into his place, and the great Son returned
Victorious with his Saints, The Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.



At least our envious Foe hath failed, who  thought
All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength, the seat
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,
He trusted to have seized, and into fraud
Drew many, whom their place knows here no more;

Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,
Their station, Heaven yet populous retains
Number sufficient to possess her Realms
Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent
With Ministries due and solemn Rites:
But least his heart exalt him in the harm
Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heaven
My damage fondly deemed, I can repair
That detriment, if such it be to lose
Self-lost, and in a moment will create
Another World, out of one man a Race
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
Not here, till by degrees of merit raised
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience tried,
And Earth be changed to Heaven, & Heaven to Earth,
One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven,
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee
I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth,
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I uncircumscribed my self retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessity and Chance
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.



So spake the almighty, and to what he spake
His Word, the filial Godhood, gave effect.
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
Then time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,


So told as earthly notion can receive.
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
When such was heard declared the Almightie's will;
Glory they sung to the most High, good will
To future men, and in their dwellings peace:
Glory to him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out th'ungodly from his sight
And th'habitations of the just; to him
Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create, in stead
Of Spirits malign a better Race to bring
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
On his great Expedition now appeared,
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine, Sapience and Love
Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
About his Chariot numberless were poured
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
And Virtues, winged Spirits, and Chariots winged,
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodged
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
The King of Glory in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore
They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,

Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
Heavens height, and with the Center mix the Pole.



Silence, ye troubled waves, and thou Deep, peace,

 Said then th'Omnific Word,
 your  discord end:

 Nor staid, but on the Wings of
Cherubim
Uplifted, in Paternal Glory rode
Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;
For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Train
Followed in bright procession to behold
Creation, and the wonders of his might.
Then staid the fervid Wheels, and in his hand
He took the golden Compasses, prepared
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
This Universe, and all created things:
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure,
And said,  thus far extend, thus
far thy bounds,
This be thy just Circumference, O World.

 Thus God the Heaven created, thus
the Earth,
Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound
Covered th'Abyss: but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purged
The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
Like things to like, the rest to several place
Disported, and between spun out the Air,
And Earth self balanced on her Center hung.



Let there be Light,  said God,
and  forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
To journey through the airy gloom began,


Sphered in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
Was not; she in a cloudy Tabernacle
Sojourned the while.  God saw the Light was good;
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
He named.  Thus was the first Day Even and Morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
The hollow Universal Orb they filled,
And touched their Golden Harps, and hymning praised
God and his works, Creator him they sung,
Both when first Evening was, and when first Morn.


Again, God said,  let there be
Firmament
Amid the Waters, and let it divide
The Waters from the Waters:  and
God made
The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
The Waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
Built on circumfluous Waters calm, in wide
Crystalline Ocean, and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed, least fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heaven he named the Firmament: So Even
And Morning Chorus sung the second Day.


The Earth was formed, but in the Womb as yet
Of Waters, Embryon immature involved,
Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
Main Ocean flowed, not idle, but with warm
Prolific humour softening all her Globe,

Fermented the great Mother to conceive,
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said

 Be gathered now ye Waters under
Heaven
Into one place, and let dry Land appear.

 Immediately the Mountains huge
appear
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
Into the Clouds, their tops ascend the Sky:
So high as heaved the tumid Hills, so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry;
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
For haste; such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods: as Armies at the call
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou has heard)
Troop to their Standard, so the watery throng,
Wave rolling after Wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plain,
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With Serpent error wandering, found their way,
And on the wash Ooze deep Channels wore;
Easy, ever God had bid the ground be dry,
All but within those banks, where Rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
Of congregated Waters he called Seas:
And saw that it was good, and said,
 Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed,
And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind;
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.

 He scarce had said, when the bare
Earth, till then
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,


Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden floured
Opening their various colours, and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
Forth flourished thick the clustering Vine, forth crept
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
Embattled in her field: and the humble Shrub,
And Bush with frizzled hair implicit: last
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spread
Their branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd
Their blossoms: with high woods the hills were crowned,
With tufts the valleys and each fountain side,
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now
Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
None was, but from the Earth a dewy Mist
Went up and watered all the ground, and each
Plant of the field, which ever it was in the Earth
God made, and every Herb, before it grew
On the green stem; God saw that it was good.
So Even and Morn recorded the Third Day.


Again the almighty spake: 
Let there be Lights
High in the expanse of Heaven to divide
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signs,
For Seasons, and for Days, and circling Years,
And let them be for Lights as I ordain
Their Office in the Firmament of Heaven
To give Light on the Earth;  and
it was so.
And God made two great Lights, great for their use
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
The less by Night alterne: and made the Stars,

And set them in the Firmament of Heaven
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
In their vicissitude, and rule the Night,
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
A mighty Sphere he framed, unlightsom first,
Though of Ethereal Mould: then formed the Moon
Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,
And sowed with Stars the Heaven thick as a field:
Of Light by far the greater part he took,
Transplanted from her cloudy Shrine, and placed
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retain
Her gathered beams, great Palace now of Light.
Hither as to their Fountain other Stars
Repairing, in their golden Urns draw Light,
And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns;
By tincture or reflection they augment
Their small peculiar, though from human sight
So far remote, with diminution seen.
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
Regent of Day, and all the Horizon round
Invested with bright Rays, jocund to run
His Longitude through Heavens high rode: the gray
Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
But opposite in leveled West was set
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
From him, for other light she needed none
In that aspect, and still that distance keeps
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
Revolved on Heavens great Axle, and her Reign
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,

With thousand thousand Stars, that then appeared
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adorned
With their bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
Glad Evening and glad Morn crowned the fourth day.


And God said,  let the Waters
generate
Reptile with Spawn abundant, living Soul:
And let Foul fly above the Earth, with wings
Displayed on the open Firmament of Heaven.

 And God created the great Whales,
and each
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
The waters generated by their kinds,
And every Bird of wing after his kind;
And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and in the
Seas
And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;
And let the Foul be multiplied on the Earth.

 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas,
each Creek and Bay
With Fry innumerable swarm, and Shoals
Of Fish that with their Finns and shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave, in Sculls that oft
Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
Graze the Sea weed their pasture, and through Groves
Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
Show to the Sun their waved coats dropped with Gold,
Or in their Pearlie shells at ease, attend
Moist nutriment, or under Rocks their food
In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seal,
And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their Gate
Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
Stretched like a Promontory sleeps or swims,
And seems a moving Land, and at his Gills
Draws in, and at his Trunk spouts out a Sea.

Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shores
Their Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
Their callow young, but feathered soon and fledge
They summed their Pens, and soaring the air sublime
With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
On Cliffs and Cedar tops their Eyries build:
Part loosely wing the Region, part more wise
In common, ranged in figure wedge their way,
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
Their Aerie Caravan high over Sea's
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
Easing their flight; so steers the prudent Crane
Her annual Voyage, born on Winds; the Air
Floats, as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
Solaced the Woods, and spread their painted wings
Till Even, nor then the solemn Nightingale
Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays:
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bathed
Their downy Breast; the Swan with Arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rows
Her state with Oar feet: yet oft they quit
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, tower
The mid Aerial Sky: Others on ground
Walked firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours, and the other whose gay Train
Adorns him, coloured with the Florid hue
Of Rainbows and Starry Eyes.  The Waters thus
With Fish replenished, and the Air with Foul,
Evening and Morn solemnised the Fifth day.


The Sixth, and of Creation last arose
With Evening Harps and Mitten, when God said,


 Let the Earth bring forth Foul
living in her kind,
Cattle and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,
Each in their kind.   The Earth
obeyed, and strait
Opening her fertile Womb teemed at a Birth
numerous living Creatures, perfect forms,
Limbed and full grown: out of the ground up rose
As from his Lair the wilde Beast where he one
In Forest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walked:
The Cattle in the Fields and Meadows green:
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
The grassy Clods now Calv'd, now half appeared
The Tawny Lion, pawing to get free
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
The Leopard, and the Tiger, as the Moil
Rising, the crumbled Earth above them threw
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head: scarce from his mould

Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
His vastness: Fleeced the Flocks and bleating rose,
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
The River Horse and scaly Crocodile.
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
Insect or Worm; those waved their limber fans
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
These as a line their long dimension drew,
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kind
Wondrous in length and corpulence involved
Their Snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept

The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
Of future, in small room large heart enclosed,
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter, joined in her popular Tribes
Of Commonalty: swarming next appeared
The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
With Honey stored: the rest are numberless,
And thou their Natures know, & gave them Names,
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen Eyes
And hairy Main terrific, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heaven in all her Glory shone, and rolled
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
First wheeled their course; Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled; Air, Water, Earth,
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walked
Frequent; and of the Sixth day yet remained;
There wanted yet the Master work, the end
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
And Brute as other Creatures, but endued
With Sanctity of Reason, might erect
His Stature, and upright with Front serene
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in Devotion, to adore
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father (For where is not he
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.


 Let us make now Man in our image, Man
In our similitude, and let them rule
Over the Fish and Foul of Sea and Air,
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
 This said, he formed thee, Adam,
thee O Man
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of Life; in his own Image he
Created thee, in the Image of God
Express, and thou became a living Soul.
Male he created thee, but thy consort
Female for Race; then blessed Mankind, and said,

 Be fruitful, multiply, and fill
the Earth,
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold
Over Fish of the Sea, and Foul of the Air,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.

 Wherever thus created, for no
place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste;
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
Variety without end; but of the Tree
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
Thou may not; in the day thou eats, thou did;
Death is the penalty imposed, beware,
And govern well thy appetite, least sin
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
Here finished he, and all that he had made
Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
So Even and Morn accomplished the Sixth day:
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned

Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode,
Thence to behold this new created World
Th'addition of his Empire, how it showed
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how fair,
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand Harps that tuned
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Air
Resounded, (thou remember, for thou heard)
The Heavens and all the Constellations rung,
The Planets in their station listening stood,
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

 Open, ye everlasting Gates,
 they  sung,

 Open, ye Heavens, your living
doors; let in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged Messengers
On errands of supernal Grace.   So
sung
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heaven,
That opened wide her blazing Portals, led
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
And pavement Stars, as Stars to thee appear,
Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky way
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou see
Pouderd with Stars.  And now on Earth the Seventh
Evening arose in Eden, for the Sun
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
Of Heavens high-seated top, the empyreal Throne
Of Godhood, fixed for ever firm and sure,

The Filial Power arrived, and sate him down
With his great Father (for he also went
Invisible, yet staid (such privilege
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,
Author and end of all things, and from work
Now resting, blessed and hallowed the Seventh day,
As resting on that day from all his work,
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
Tempered soft Tunings, intermixed with Voice
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
Creation and the Six days acts they sung,

 Great are thy works, Jehovah,
infinite
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee; greater now in thy return
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
Thy Thunders magnified; but to create
Is greater then created to destroy.
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their Counsels vain
Thou has repealed, while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might: his evil
Thou use, and from thence creates more good.
Witness this new-made World, another Heaven
From Heaven Gate not far, founded in view
On the clear Hyaline, the Glassy Sea;
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's

Numerous, and every Star perhaps a World
Of destined habitation; but thou know
Their seasons: among these the seat of men,
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,
Their pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happy men,
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanced,
Created in his Image, there to dwell
And worship him, and in reward to rule
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
And multiply a Race of Worshippers
Holy and just: thrice happy if they know
Their happiness, and persevere upright.

 So sung they, and the Empyrean
rung,
With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept.
And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked
How first this World and face of things began,
And what before thy memory was don
From the beginning, that posterity
Informed by thee might know; if else thou seeks
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
The End of the Seventh Book.
