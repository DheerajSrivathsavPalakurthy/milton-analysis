            Paradise Lost. Book VI.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
Raphael continues to relate how Michael and
Gabriel were  sent forth to battle against Satan and
his Angels.  The  first Fight described: Satan and his
Powers retire under  Night: He calls a Council, invents devilish
Engines, which in the  second days Fight put Michael and his
Angels to some disorder;   but they at length pulling up Mountains
overwhelmed both the  force and Machins of Satan: Yet the
Tumult not so ending, God  on the third day sends Messiah his
Son, for whom he had  reserved the glory of that Victory: He in the
Power of his  Father coming to the place, and causing all his Legions to
stand  still on either side, with his Chariot and Thunder driving into 
the midst of his Enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards  the
wall of Heaven;  which opening, they leap down with horror  and
confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in  the Deep:
Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.



ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursued
Through Heavens wide Champagne held his way, till Morn,
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
Unbarred the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven, arrayed in Gold
Imperial, from before her vanished Night,
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
Coverd with thick embattled Squadrons bright,
Chariots and flaming Arms, and fiery Steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct, and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly Powers who him received
With joy and acclamation loud, that one
That of so many Myriads fallen, yet one
Returned not lost: On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice
From midst a Golden Cloud thus mild was heard.



Servant of God, well done, well has thou  fought
The better fight, who single has maintained
Against revolted multitudes the Cause
Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Arms;
And for the testimony of Truth has born    


Universal reproach, far worse to bear
Then violence: for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God, though Worlds
Judged thee perverse: the easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Then scorned thou did depart, and to subdue
By force, who reason for their Law refuse,
Right reason for their Law, and for their King

Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns.
Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince,
And thou in Military prowess next

Gabriel, lead forth to Battle these my Sons
Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints
By Thousands and by Millions ranged for fight;
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,
Into their place of punishment, the Gulf
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.



So spake the Soverign voice, and Clouds began
To darken all the Hill, and smoke to roll
In dusky wreathes, reluctant flames, the sign
Of wrath awaked: nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal Trumpet from on high began blow:
At which command the Powers Militant,
That stood for Heaven, in mighty Quadrate join"d
Of Union irresistible, moved on
In silence their bright Legions, to the sound
Of instrumental Harmony that breathed
Heroic Ardor to adventurous deeds
Under their God-like Leaders, in the Cause

Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
Indissoluble firm; nor obvious Hill,
Nor straitening Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
Their march was, and the passive Air upbore
Their nimble tread, as when the total kind
Of Birds in orderly array on wing
Came summoned over Eden to receive
Their names of thee; so over many a tract
Of Heaven they marched, and many a Province wide
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
Far in the Horizon to the North appeared
From skirt to skirt a fiery Region, stretched
In battailous aspect, and nearer view
Bristled with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets thronged, and Shields
Various, with boastful Argument portrait,
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
With furious expedition; for they weend
That self same day by fight, or by surprise
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
To set the envier of his State, the proud
Aspirer, but their thoughts proved fond and vain
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemed
At first, that Angel should with Angel war,
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
So oft in Festivals of joy and love
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
Hymning the Eternal Father: but the shout
Of Battle now began, and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
High in the midst exalted as a God
the apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
Idol of Majesty Divine, enclosed 


With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length: before the cloudy Van,
On the rough edge of battle ere it join,d,

Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced,
Came towering, armed in Adamant and Gold;

Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.



O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain, where faith and realty
Remain not; wherefore should not strength and might
There fail where Virtue fails, or weakest prove
Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?
His puissance, trusting in the almighty's aide,
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tried
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike
Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,
When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so
Most reason is that Reason overcome.



So pondering, and from his armed Peers
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
His daring foe, at this prevention more
Incensed, and thus securely him defied.



Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached
The height of thy aspiring unopposed,
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side
Abandoned at the terror of thy Power
Or potent tongue; foo, not to think how vain

Against The Omnipotent to rise in Arms;
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have raised incessant Armies to defeat
Thy folly; or with solitary hand
Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
Unaided could have finished thee, and whelmed
Thy Legions under darkness; but thou see
All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith
Prefer, and Piety to God, though then
To thee not visible, when I alone
Seemed in thy World erroneous to dissent
From all: my Sect thou see, now learn too late
How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.



Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in
wished hour
Of my revenge, first sought for thou return
From flight, seditious Angel, to receive
Thy merited reward, the first assay
Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue
Inspired with contradiction dared oppose
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met
Their Deities to assert, who while they feel
Vigour Divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou come
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
From me some Plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest: this pause between
(Unanswered least thou boast) to let thee know;
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
To heavenly Souls had bin all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Ministering Spirits, trained up in Feast and Song;
Such has thou armed, the Minstrelsy of Heaven,
Servility with freedom to contend,


As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.



To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.

 Apostate, still thou erst, nor end
wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depraves it with the name
Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthralled;
Yet lewdly dare our ministering upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let me serve
In Heaven God ever blessed, and his Divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed,
Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while
From me returned, as erst thou said, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

 So saying, a noble stroke he
lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
His massy Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong, had pushed a Mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seized
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
Thus foiled their mightiest, ours joy filled, and shout,
Presage of Victory and fierce desire
Of Battle: whereat Michael bid sound
The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven

It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung

Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joined
The horrid shock: now storming fury rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing brayed
Horrible discord, and the matting Wheels
Of brazen Chariots raged; dire was the noise
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery Darts in flaming voles flew,
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
So under fiery Cope together rushed
Both Battles maine, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage; all Heaven
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These Elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their Regions: how much more of Power
Army against Army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, their happy Native seat;
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heaven high over-ruled
And limited their might; though numbered such
As each divided Legion might have seemed
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemed
Each Warrior single as in Chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of Battle, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim War; no thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed

That argued fear; each on himself relied,
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory; deeds of eternal fame
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spread
That War and various; sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemed then
Conflicting Fire: long time in even scale
The Battle hung; till Satan, who that day
Prodigious power had shown, and met in Arms
No equal, ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and felled
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and opposed the rocky Orb
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
A vast circumference: At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
Surceased, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine War in Heaven, the arch foe subdued
Or Captive dragged in Chains, with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began.



Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous, as thou see
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
And thy adherents: how has thou disturb d
Heavens blessed peace, and into Nature brought
Misery, uncreated till the crime
Of thy Rebellion? how has thou instilled
Thy malice into thousands, once upright
And faithful, now proved false.  But think not here

To trouble Holy Rest; Heaven casts thee out
From all her Confines.  Heaven the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and War.
Hence then, and evil go with thee along
Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broils,
Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doom,
Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
Precipitate thee with augmented pain.



So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
The Adversary.  Nor think thou with
wind
Of airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds
Thou can not.  has thou turned the least of these
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquished, easier to transact with me
That thou should hope, imperious, and with threats
To chase me hence? err not that so shall end
The strife which thou call evil, but wee style
The strife of Glory: which we mean to win,
Or turn this Heaven it self into the Hell
Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,
If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,
And join him named Almighty to thy aid,
I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.



They ended parley, and both addressed for fight
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
Human imagination to such height
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemed,
Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heaven.
Now waved their fiery Swords, and in the Air
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns their Shields

Blazed opposite, while expectation stood
In horror; from each hand with speed retired
Where erst was thickest fight, the Angelic throng,
And left large field, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion, such as to set forth
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
Among the Constellations war were sprung,
Two Planets rushing from aspect malign
Of fiercest opposition in mid Sky,
Should combat, and their jarring Spears confound.
Together both with next to Almighty Arm,
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed
That might determine, and not need repeat,
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeared
In might or swift prevention; but the sword
Of Michael from the Armoury of God
Was given him tempered so, that neither keen
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
Descending, and in half cut sheer, nor staid,
But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering shared
All his right side; then Satan first knew pain,
And writhed him to and fro convolv'd; so sore
The griding sword with discontinuous wound
Passed through him, but the Ethereal substance closed
Not long divisible, and from the gash
A stream of Nectarous humour issuing flowed
Sanguine, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
And all his Armour stained ere while so bright.
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
By Angels many and strong, who interposed
Defence, while others bore him on their Shields
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retired
From off the files of war; there they him laid

Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless, and his pride
Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath
His confidence to equal God in power.
Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man
In Entrails, Heart or Head, Liver or Reins;
Cannot but by annihilating die;
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
Receive, no more then can the fluid Air:
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Ear,
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.


Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
And with fierce Ensigns pierced the deep array
Of Moloc furious King, who him defied,
And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
Down cloven to the waste, with shattered Arms
And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing

Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armed,
Vanquished Adramelec, and Asmadai,
Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
Mangled with ghastly wounds through Plate and Mail,
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
The Atheist crew, but with redoubled blow

Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew.
I might relate of thousands, and their names

Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
In might though wondrous and in Acts of War,
Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doom
Concealed from Heaven and sacred memory,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
And ignominy, yet to glory aspires
Vain glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
Therefore Eternal silence be their doom.


And now their Mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
With many an inrode gored; deformed rout
Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiverd armour strewn, and on a heap
Chariot and Charioteer lay overturn
And fiery foaming Steeds; what stood, recoiled
Overwearied, through the faint Satanic Host
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience, till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or pain.
Far otherwise th'inviolable Saints
In Cubic Phalanx firm advanced entire,
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed:
Such high advantages their innocence
Gave them above their foes, not to have send,
Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
By wound, though from their place by violence moved.


Now Night her course began, and over Heaven
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,

And silence on the odious din of War:
Under her Cloudy covert both retired,
Victor and Vanquished: on the foughten field

Michael and his Angels prevalent
Encamping, placed in Guard their Watches round,
Cherubic waving fires: on the other part

Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
Far in the dark dislodged, and void of rest,
His Potentates to Council called by night;
And in the midst thus undismayed began.



O now in danger tried, now known in Arms
Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,
Found worthy not of Liberty alone,
Too mean pretence, but what we more affect,
Honour, Dominion, Glory, and renown,
Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight
(And if one day, why not Eternal days?)
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his Throne, and judged
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,
Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,
Some disadvantage we endured and pain,
Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,
Since now we find this our Imperial form
Incapable of mortal injury
Imperishable, and though pierced with wound,
Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
Of evil then so small as easy think
The remedy; perhaps more valid Arms,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
Or equal what between us made the odds,

In Nature none: if other hidden cause
Left them Superior, while we can preserve
Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,
Due search and consultation will disclose.



He sat; and in The Assembly next upstood

Nisroc, of Principalities the prime;
As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,
Sore toiled, his riven Arms to havoc hewn,
And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.

 Deliverer from new Lords, leader
to free
Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
For Gods, and too unequal work we find
Against unequal arms to fight in pain,
Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well
Spare out of life perhaps, and not rapine,
But live content, which is the calmest life:
But pain is perfect misery, the worst
Of evils, and excessive, overturns
All patience.  He who therefore can invent
With what more forcible we may offend
Our yet unwonted Enemies, or arm
Our selves with like defence, to me deserves
No less then for deliverance what we owe.



Where to with look composed Satan replied.
 Not uninvented that, which thou aright
Believst so main to our success, I bring;
Which of us who beholds the bright surface
Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,
This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned
With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gems & Gold,

Whose Eye so superficially surveys
These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
Of spirituous and fiery spume, till touched
With Heavens ray, and tempered they shoot forth
So beauteous, opening to the ambient light.
These in their dark Nativity the Deep
Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame,
Which into hallow Engines long and round
Thick-rammd, at the other bore with touch of fire
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
From far with thundering noise among our foes
Such implements of mischief as shall dash
To pieces, and overwhelm whatever stands
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawn,
Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joint
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.

 He ended, and his words their
drooping chere
Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
Th'invention all admired, and each, how he
To be th'inventer missed, so easy it seemed
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible: yet happily of thy Race
In future days, if Malice should abound,
Some one intent on mischief, or inspired
With devilish machination might devise
Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
Forthwith from Council to the work they flew,
None arguing stood, innumerable hands
Were ready, in a moment up they turned


Wide the Celestial soil, and saw beneath
Th'originals of Nature in their crude
Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foam
They found, they mingled, and with subtle Art,
Concocted and adusted they reduced
To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this Earth
Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
Whereof to found their Engines and their Balls
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night
Secret they finished, and in order set,
With silent circumspection unespied.
Now when fair Morn Orient in Heaven appeared
Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
Of Golden Panoply, refulgent Host,
Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
Looked round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scour,
Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,
Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
In motion or in alt: him soon they met
Under spread Ensigns moving nigh, in slow
But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail

Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
Came flying, and in mid Air aloud thus cried.



Arm, Warriors, Arm for fight, the foe at hand,
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud
He comes, and settled in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure: let each
His Adamantine coat gird well, and each
Fit well his Helm, gripe fast his orbit Shield,

Born even or high, for this day will pour down,
If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,
But rattling storm of Arrows barbed with fire.

 So warned he them aware
themselves, and soon
In order, quit of all impediment;
Instant without disturb they took Alarm,
And onward move Embattled; when behold
Not distant far with heavy pace the Foe
Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
Training his devilish Enginrie, impaled
On every side with shadowing Squadrons Deep,
To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
A while, but suddenly at head appeared

Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud.



Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfold;
That all may see who hate us, how we seek
Peace and composure, and with open breast
Stand ready to receive them, if they like
Our overture, and turn not back perverse;
But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,
Heaven witness thou anon, while we discharge
Freely our part; ye who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.



So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce,
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
Divided, and to either Flank retired.
Which to our eyes discovered new and strange,
A triple mounted row of Pillars laid
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seemed
Or hollowed bodies made of Oak or Fur
With branches lopped, in Wood or Mountain felled)
Brass, Iron, Stony mould, had not their mouths
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,


Portending hollow truce; at each behind
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
Stood waving tipped with fire; while we suspense,
Collected stood within our thoughts amused,
Not long, for sudden all at once their Reeds
Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,
From those deep throated Engines belched, whose roar
Emboweld with outrageous noise the Air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
Their devilish glut, chained Thunderbolts and Hail
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
That whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;
The sooner for their Arms, unarmed they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove; but now
Foul dissipation followed and forced rout;
Nor served it to relax their serried files.
What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
Repeated, and indecent overthrow
Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
And to their foes a laughter; for in view
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode their second tire
Of Thunder: back defeated to return
They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,
And to his Mates thus in derision ca11'd.



O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,
To entertain them fair with open Front

And Breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms
Of composition, strait they changed their minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemed
Somewhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps
For joy of offered peace: but I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result.



To whom thus Belial in like gamesom  mood,

 Leader, the terms we sent were
terms of weight,
Of hard contents, and full of force urged home,
Such as we might perceive amused them all,
And stumbled many, who receives them right,
Had need from head to foot well understand;
Not understood, this gift they have besides,
They show us when our foes walk not upright.



So they among themselves in pleasant vein
Stood scoffing, heightened in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of Victory, eternal might
To match with their inventions they presumed
So easy, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
And all his Host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed)
Their Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
Light as the Lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,
From their foundations loosening to and fro
They plucked the seated Hills with all their load,
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggy tops 


Up lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,
Be sure, and terror seized the rebel Host,
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the Mountains upward turned,
Till on those cursed Engines triple-row
They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
Came shadowing, and oppressed whole Legions armed,
Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
The rest in imitation to like Arms
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
So Hills amid the Air encountered Hills
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
Infernal noise; War seemed a civil Game
To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heaven
Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspread,
Had not the almighty Father where he sits
shrined in his Sanctuary of Heaven secure,
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
To honour his Anointed Son avenged
Upon his enemies, and to declare
All power on him transferred: whence to his Son
Th'Assessor of his Throne he thus began.


 Effulgence of my Glory, Son beloved,
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly, what by Deity I am,
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,
Second Omnipotence, two days are past,
Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient; sore hath been their fight,
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met armed;
For to themselves I left them, and thou know,
Equal in their Creation they were formed,
Save what sin hath impaired, which yet hath wrought
Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless, and no solution will be found:
War wearied hath performed what War can do,
And to disordered rage let loose the reins,
With Mountains as with Weapons armed, which makes
Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the maine.
Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;
For thee I have ordained it, and thus far
Have suffered, that the Glory may be thine
Of ending this great War, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such Virtue and Grace
Immense I have transfused, that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy Power above compare,
And this perverse Commotion governed thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels
That shake Heavens basis, bring forth all my War,
My Bow and Thunder, my Almighty Arms


Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out
From all Heavens bounds into the utter Deep:
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
God and Messiah his anointed King.



He said, and on his Son with Rays direct
Shone full, he all his Father full expressed
Ineffably into his face received,
And thus the filial Godhood answering spake.



O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou always seeks
To glorify thy Son, I always thee,
As is most just; this I my Glory account,
My exaltation, and my whole delight,
That thou in me well pleased, declare thy will
Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
Sceptre and Power, thy giving, I assume,
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee
For ever, and in me all whom thou love:
But whom thou hates, I hate, and can put on
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
Armed with thy might, rid heaven of these rebelled,
To their prepared ill Mansion driven down
To chains of darkness, and the undying Worm,
That from thy just obedience could revolt,
Whom to obey is happiness entire.
Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from th'impure
Far separate, circling thy holy Mount
Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.
So said, he o'er his Sceptre bowing, rose
From the right hand of Glory where he sate,

And the third sacred Morn began to shine
Dawning through Heaven: forth rushed with whirlwind sound
The Chariot of Paternal Deity,                   
Flashing thick flames, Wheel within Wheel undrawn,
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyed
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each
Had wondrous, as with Stars their bodies all
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;
Over their heads a crystal Firmament,
Whereon a Sapphire Throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the shower Arch.
He in Celestial Panoply all armed
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
Ascended, at his right hand Victory
Sate Eagle-winged, beside him hung his Bow
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stored,
And from about him fierce Effusion rolled
Of smoke and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came, far off his coming shone,
And twenty thousand (I their number heard)
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the Crystalline Sky, in Sapphire Throned.
Illustrious far and wide, but by his own
First seen, them unexpected joy surprised,
When the great Ensign of Messiah blazed
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heaven:
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
His Army, circumfus'd on either Wing,
Under their Head embodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepared;
At his command the uprooted Hills retired

Each to his place, they heard his voice and went
Obsequious, Heaven his wonted face renewed,
And with fresh Flowerets Hill and Valley smiled.
This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur'd,
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what Signs avail,
Or Wonders move th'obdurate to relent?
They hardened more by what might most reclaim,
Grieving to see his Glory, at the sight
Took envy, and aspiring to his height,
Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud
Weaning to prosper, and at length prevail
Against God and Messiah, or to fall
In universal ruin last, and now
To final Battle drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.



Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here  stand
Ye Angels armed, this day from Battle rest;
Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,
And as ye have received, so have ye don
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs,
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;
Number to this days work is not ordained
Nor multitude, stand only and behold
Gods indignation on these Godless poured
By me, not you but me they have despised,
Yet envied; against me is all their rage,
Because the Father, They whom in Heaven supreme
Kingdom and Power and Glory appertains,

Hath honoured me according to his will.
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;
That they may have their wish, to try with me
In Battle which the stronger proves, they all,
Or I alone against them, since by strength
They measure all, of other excellence
Not emulous, nor care who them excels;
Nor other strife with them do I voutchsafe.



So spake the Son, and into terror changed
His countenance too severe to be beheld
And full of wrath bent on his Enemies.
At once the Four spread out their Starry wings
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbs
Of his fierce Chariot rolled, as with the sound
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
He on his impious Foes right onward drove,
Gloomy as Night; under his burning Wheels
The steadfast Empyrean shook throughout,
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon
Among them he arrived; in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
Before him, such as in their Souls infixed
Plagues; they astonished all resistance lost,
All courage; down their idle weapons dropped;
O'er Shields and Helmes, and helmet heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
That wished the Mountains now might be again
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Four,
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
One Spirit in them ruled, and every eye
Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire

Among th'accurst, that withered all their strength,
And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
His Thunder in mid Volly, for he meant
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:
The overthrown he raised, and as a Heard
Of Goats or timorous flock together thronged
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursued
With terrors and with furies to the bounds
And Crystal wall of Heaven, which opening wide,
Rolled inward, and a spacious Gap disclosed
Into the wistful Deep; the monstrous sight
Struck them with horror backward, but far worse
Urged them behind; headlong themselves they threw
Down from the verge of Heaven, Eternal wrath
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.


Hell heard th'unsufferable noise, Hell saw
Heaven ruining from Heaven and would have fled
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
Nine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared,
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
Through his wilde Anarchy, so huge a rout
Encumbered him with ruin: Hell at last
Yawning received them whole, and on them closed,
Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired
Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
Sole Victor from th'expulsion of his Foes

Messiah his triumphal Chariot turned:
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
Eye witnesses of his Almighty Acts,

With Jubilee advanced; and as they went,
Shaded with branching Palm, each order bright,
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion given,
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the Courts
And Temple of his mighty Father Throned
On high: who into Glory him received,
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.


Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth
At thy request, and that thou may beware
By what is past, to thee I have revealed
What might have else to human Race bin hid;
The discord which befell, and War in Heaven
Among the Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled
With Satan, he who envies now thy state,
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee also from obedience, that with him
Bereaved of happiness thou may partake
His punishment, Eternal misery;
Which would be all his solace and revenge,
As a despite don against the most High,
Thee once to gain Companion of his woe.
But list'n not to his Temptations, warn
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
By terrible Example the reward
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
The End of the Sixth Book.
