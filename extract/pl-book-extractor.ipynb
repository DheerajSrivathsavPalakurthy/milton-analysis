       "\"\\n            Paradise Lost. Book II.\\n            THE ARGUMENT.\\n            The Consultation begun, Satan debates whether anothere\\nBattle be to be hazarded for the recovery of Heyven: some  advise\\nit, others dissuade:  A third proposal is preferred,  mentioned\\nbefore by Satan to search the truth of that Prophecy  or\\nTradition in Heaven concerning another world, and another kind  of creature\\nequal or not much inferior to themselves, about  this time to be\\ncreated:  Their doubt who shall be sent on this  difficult search: Satan\\ntheir chief undertakes alone the  voyage, is honoured and applauded.\\n The Council thus ended,  the rest betake them several ways and to\\nseveral employments, as  their inclinations lead them, to entertain the\\ntime till \\nSatan return.  He passes on his Journey to Hell Gates, \\nfinds them shut, and who sat there to guard them, by whom at  length\\nthey are opened, and discover to him the great Gulf between  Hell and\\nHeaven;  with what difficulty he passes through,  directed by Chaos,\\nthe Power of that place, to the sight of  this new World which he\\nsought.\\n\\n\\n\\nHIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far\\nOutshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,\\nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand\\nShowers on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold,\\nSatan exalted sat, by merit raised\\nTo that bad eminence; and from despair\\nThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\\nBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\\nVain War with Heaven, and by success untaught\\nHis proud imaginations thus displayed.\\n\\n\\n\\nPowers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven,\\nFor since no deep within her gulf can hold\\nImmortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,\\nI give not Heaven for lost.  From this descent\\nCelestial virtues rising, will appear\\nMore glorious and more dread then from no fall,\\nAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate:\\nMe though just right, and the fixed Laws of Heaven\\nDid first create your Leader, next free choice,\\nWith what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,\\nHath bin achieved of merit, yet this loss\\nThus far at least recovered, hath much more\\nEstablished in a safe unenvied Throne\\nYielded with full consent.  The happier state\\nIn Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw\\nEnvy from each inferior; but who here\\nWill envy whom the highest place exposes\\nForemost to stand against the Thunderers aim\\nYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\\nOf endless pain? where there is then no good\\nFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there\\nFrom Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell \\n\\nPrecedence, none, whose portion is so small\\nOf present pain, that with ambitious mind\\nWill covet more.  With this advantage then\\nTo union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,\\nMore then can be in Heaven, we now return\\nTo claim our just inheritance of old,\\nSurer to prosper then prosperity\\nCould have assured us; and by what best way,\\nWhether of open War or covert guile,\\nWe now debate; who can advise, may speak.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe ceased, and next him Moloc, Sceptred King\\nStood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\\nThat fought in Heaven; now fiercer by despair:\\nHis trust was with the Eternal to be deemed\\nEqual in strength, and rather then be less\\nCared not to be at all; with that care lost\\nWent all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse\\nHe reckoned not, and these words thereafter spake.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy sentence is for open War: Of Wiles,\\nMore inexpert, I boast not: them let those\\nContrive who need, or when they need, not now.\\nFor while they sit contriving, shall the rest,\\nMillions that stand in Arms, and longing wait\\nThe Signal to ascend, sit lingering here\\nHeavens fugitives, and for their dwelling place\\nAccept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,\\nThe Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns\\nBy our delay? no, let us rather choose\\nArmed with Hell flames and fury all at once\\nO'er Heavens high Towers to force resistless way,\\nTurning our Tortures into horrid Arms\\nAgainst the Torturer; when to meet the noise\\nOf his Almighty Engine he shall hear\\nInfernal Thunder, and for Lightning see \\n\\nBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage\\nAmong his Angels; and his Throne it self\\nMixed with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire,\\nHis own invented Torments.  But perhaps\\nThe way seems difficult and steep to scale\\nWith upright wing against a higher foe.\\nLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\\nOf that forgetful Lake benumm not still,\\nThat in our proper motion we ascend\\nUp to our native seat: descent and fall\\nTo us is adverse.  Who but felt of late\\nWhen the fierce Foe hung on our broken Rear\\nInsulting, and pursued us through the Deep,\\nWith what compulsion and laborious flight\\nWe sunk thus low? The ascent is easy then;\\nThe event is feared; should we again provoke\\nOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\\nTo our destruction: if there be in Hell\\nFear to be worse destroyed: what can be worse\\nThen to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned\\nIn this abhorred deep to utter woe;\\nWhere pain of inextinguishable fire\\nMust exercise us without hope of end\\nThe Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge\\nInexorably, and the torturing hour\\nCalls us to Penance? More destroyed then thus\\nWe should be quite abolished and expire.\\nWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense\\nHis utmost ire? which to the height enraged,\\nWill either quite consume us, and reduce\\nTo nothing this essential, happier far\\nThen miserable to have eternal being:\\nOr if our substance be indeed Divine,\\nAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst \\n\\nOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel\\nOur power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,\\nAnd with perpetual inroads to Alarm,\\nThough inaccessible, his fatal Throne:\\nWhich if not Victory is yet Revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe ended frowning, and his look denounced\\nDesperate revenge, and Battle dangerous\\nTo less then Gods.  On the other side up rose\\n\\nBelial, in act more graceful and humane;\\nA fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed\\nFor dignity composed and high exploit:\\nBut all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\\nDropped Manna, and could make the worse appear\\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\\nMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;\\nTo vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\\nTimorous and slothful: yet he pleased the ear,\\nAnd with persuasive accent thus began.\\n\\n\\n\\nI should be much for open War, O Peers,\\nAs not behind in hate; if what was urged\\nMain reason to persuade immediate War,\\nDid not dissuade me most, and seem to cast\\nOminous conjecture on the whole success:\\nWhen he who most excels in fact of Arms,\\nIn what he counsels and in what excels\\nMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\\nAnd utter dissolution, as the scope\\nOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.\\nFirst, what Revenge? the Towers of Heaven are filled\\nWith Armed watch, that render all access\\nImpregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\\nEncamp their Legions, or with obscure wing\\nScout far and wide into the Realm of night,\\nScorning surprise.  Or could we break our way \\n\\nBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise\\nWith blackest Insurrection, to confound\\nHeavens purest Light, yet our great Enemy\\nAll incorruptible would on his Throne\\nSit unpolluted, and the Ethereal mould\\nIncapable of stain would soon expel\\nHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire\\nVictorious.  Thus repulsed, our final hope\\nIs flat despair: we must exasperate\\nThe Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\\nAnd that must end us, that must be our cure,\\nTo be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\\nThough full of pain, this intellectual being,\\nThose thoughts that wander through Eternity,\\nTo perish rather, swallowed up and lost\\nIn the wide womb of uncreated night,\\nDevoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\\nLet this be good, whether our angry Foe\\nCan give it, or will ever? how he can\\nIs doubtful; that he never will is sure.\\nWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,\\nBelike through impotence, or unaware,\\nTo give his Enemies their wish, and end\\nThem in his anger, whom his anger saves\\nTo punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\\nSay they who counsel War, we are decreed,\\nReserved and destined to Eternal woe;\\nWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,\\nWhat can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\\nThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\\nWhat when we fled amain, pursued and struck\\nWith Heavens afflicting Thunder, and besought\\nThe Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seemed\\nA refuge from those wounds: or when we lay \\n\\n\\nChained on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\\nWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires\\nAwaked should blow them into sevenfold rage\\nAnd plunge us in the flames? or from above\\nShould intermitted vengeance arm again\\nHis red right hand to plague us? what if all\\nHer stores were opened, and this Firmament\\nOf Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\\nImpending horrors, threatening hideous fall\\nOne day upon our heads; while we perhaps\\nDesigning or exhorting glorious war,\\nCaught in a fiery Tempest shall be hurled\\nEach on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey\\nOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\\nUnder yon boiling Ocean, wrapped in Chains;\\nThere to converse with everlasting groans,\\nUnrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,\\nAges of hopeless end; this would be worse.\\nWar therefore, open or concealed, alike\\nMy voice dissuades; for what can force or guile\\nWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\\nViews all things at one view? he from heavens height\\nThe final h was inked in in some copies of the 1674\\nedition, apparently at the Simmons' press.\\n\\nAll these our motions vain, sees and derides;\\nNot more Almighty to resist our might\\nThen wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\\nShall we then live thus vile, the Race  some \\ncopies have race of Heaven\\nThus trampled, thus expelled to suffer here\\nChains and these Torments? better these then worse\\nBy my advice; since fate inevitable\\nSubdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,\\nThe Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,\\nOur strength is equal, nor the Law unjust\\nThat so ordains: this was at first resolved,\\nIf we were wise, against so great a foe \\n\\nContending, and so doubtful what might fall.\\nI laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\\nAnd venturous, if that fail them, shrink and fear\\nWhat yet they know must follow, to endure\\nExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\\nThe sentence of their Conqueror: This is now\\nOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\\nOur Supreme Foe in time may much remit\\nHis anger, and perhaps thus far removed\\nNot mind us not offending, satisfied\\nWith what is punished; whence these raging fires\\nWill slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.\\nOur purer essence then will overcome\\nTheir noxious vapour, or inured not feel,\\nOr changed at length, and to the place conformed\\nIn temper and in nature, will receive\\nFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\\nThis horror will grow mild, this darkness light,\\nBesides what hope the never-ending flight\\nOf future days may bring, what chance, what change\\nWorth waiting, since our present lot appears\\nFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\\nIf we procure not to our selves more woe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus Belial with words clothed in reasons  garb\\nCounselled ignoble ease, and peaceful sloth,\\nNot peace: and after him thus Mammon spake.\\n\\n\\n\\nEither to disinthrone the King of Heaven\\nWe war, if war be best, or to regain\\nOur own right lost : him to unthrone we then\\nMay hope when everlasting Faith shall yield\\nTo fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife:\\nThe former vain to hope argues as vain\\nThe latter: for what place can be for us\\nWithin Heavens bound, unless Heavens Lord supreme \\n\\n\\nWe overpower? Suppose he should relent\\nAnd publish Grace to all, on promise made\\nOf new Subjection; with what eyes could we\\nStand in his presence humble, and receive\\nStrict Laws imposed, to celebrate his Throne\\nWith warbled Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\\nForced Halleluiahs; while he Lordly sits\\nOur envied Soverign, and his Altar breathes\\nAmbrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,\\nOur servile offerings.  This must be our task\\nIn Heaven this our delight; how wearisome\\nEternity so spent in worship paid\\nTo whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue\\nBy force impossible, by leave obtained\\nUnacceptable, though in Heaven, our state\\nOf splendid vassalage, but rather seek\\nOur own good from our selves, and from our own\\nLive to our selves, though in this vast recess,\\nFree, and to none accountable, preferring\\nHard liberty before the easy yoke\\nOf servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear\\nThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,\\nUseful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\\nWe can create, and in what place so ever\\nThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\\nThrough labour and endurance.  This deep world\\nOf darkness do we dread? How oft amidst\\nThick clouds and dark doth Heavens all-ruling Sire\\nChoose to reside, his Glory unobscured,\\nAnd with the Majesty of darkness round\\nCovers his Throne;  from whence deep thunders roar\\nMustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell?\\nAs he our darkness, cannot we his Light\\nImitate when we please? This Desert soil \\n\\nWants not her hidden lustre, Gems and Gold;\\nNor want we skill or Artsome copies have  art,\\nfrom whence to raise\\nMagnificence; and what can Heaven show more?\\nOur torments also may in length of time\\nBecome our Elements, these piercing Fires\\nAs soft as now severe, our temper changed\\nInto their temper; which must needs remove\\nThe sensible of pain.  All things invite\\nTo peaceful Counsels, and the settled State\\nOf order, how in safety best we may\\nCompose our present evils, with regard\\nOf what we are and were, dismissing quite\\nAll thoughts of war: ye have what I advise.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe scarce had finished, when such murmur filled\\nThe Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain\\nThe sound of blustering winds, which all night long\\nHad roused the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\\nSea-faring men overwatched, whose Bark by chance\\nOr Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\\nAfter the Tempest:  Such applause was heard\\nAs Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleased,\\nAdvising peace: for such another Field\\nThey dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\\nOf Thunder and the Sword of Michael\\n\\nWrought still within them; and no less desire\\nTo found this nether Empire, which might rise\\nBy policy, and long process of time,\\nIn emulation opposite to Heaven.\\nWhich when Beelzebub perceived, then whom,\\n\\nSatan except, none higher sat, with grave\\nAspect he rose, and in his rising seemed\\nA Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\\nDeliberation sat and public care;\\nAnd Princely counsel in his face yet shone, \\n\\n\\nMajestic though in ruin: sage he stood\\nWith Atlantean shoulders fit to bear\\nThe weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\\nDrew audience and attention still as Night\\nOr Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of  heaven\\nEthereal Virtues; or these Titles now\\nMust we renounce, and changing stile be called\\nPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote\\nInclines, here to continue, and build up here\\nA growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,\\nAnd know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed\\nThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\\nBeyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\\nFrom Heavens high jurisdiction, in new League\\nBanded against his Throne, but to remain\\nIn strictest bondage, though thus far removed,\\nUnder the inevitable curb, reserved\\nHis captive multitude: For he, be sure\\nIn height or depth, still first and last will Reign\\nSole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part\\nBy our revolt, but over Hell extend\\nHis Empire, and with Iron Sceptre rule\\nUs here, as with his Golden those in Heaven.\\nWhat sit we then projecting peace and War?\\nWar hath determined us, and foiled with loss\\nIrreparable; terms of peace yet none\\nVouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given\\nTo us enslaved, but custody severe,\\nAnd stripes, and arbitrary punishment\\nInflicted? and what peace can we return,\\nBut to our power hostility and hate,\\nUntamed reluctance, and revenge though slow,\\nYet ever plotting how the Conqueror least \\n\\nMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoice\\nIn doing what we most in suffering feel?\\nNor will occasion want, nor shall we need\\nWith dangerous expedition to invade\\nHeaven, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\\nOr ambush from the Deep.  What if we find\\nSome easier enterprise? There is a place\\n(if ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven\\nErr not) another World, the happy seat\\nOf some new Race called Man, about this time\\nTo be created like to us, though less\\nIn power and excellence, but favoured more\\nOf him who rules above; so was his will\\nPronounced among the Gods, and by an Oath,\\nThat shook Heavens whole circumference, confirmed.\\nThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\\nWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould,\\nOr substance, how endued, and what their Power,\\nAnd where their weakness, how attempted best,\\nBy force or subtlety: Though Heaven be shut,\\nAnd Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure\\nIn his own strength, this place may lye exposed\\nThe utmost border of his Kingdom, left\\nTo their defence who hold it: here perhaps\\nSome advantageous act may be achieved\\nBy sudden onset, either with Hell fire\\nTo waste his whole Creation, or possess\\nAll as our own, and drive as we were driven,\\nThe puny habitants, or if not drive,\\nSeduce them to our Party, that their God\\nMay prove their foe, and with repenting hand\\nAbolish his own works.  This would surpass\\nCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy\\nIn our Confusion, and our joy upraise \\n\\n\\nIn his disturbance; when his darling Sons\\nHurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse\\nTheir frail Original, and faded bliss,\\nFaded so soon.  Advise if this be worth\\nAttempting, or to sit in darkness here\\nHatching vain Empires.  Thus Beelzebub\\n\\nPleaded his devilish Counsel, first devised\\nBy Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,\\nBut from the Author of all ill could Spring\\nSo deep a malice, to confound the race\\nOf mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\\nTo mingle and involve, done all to spite\\nThe great Creator? But their spite still serves\\nHis glory to augment.  The bold design\\nPleased highly those infernal States, and joy\\nSparkled in all their eyes; with full assent\\nThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell have ye judged, well ended long debate,\\nSynod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\\nGreat things resolved; which from the lowest deep\\nWill once more lift us up, in spite of Fate,\\nNearer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\\nOf those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms\\nAnd opportune excursion we may chance\\nRe-enter Heaven; or else in some mild Zone\\nDwell not unvisited of Heavens fair Light\\nSecure, and at the brightening Orient beam\\nPurge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,\\nTo heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\\nShall breathe her balm.  But first whom shall we send\\nIn search of this new world, whom shall we find\\nSufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet\\nThe dark unbottomed infinite Abyss\\nAnd through the palpable obscure find out \\n\\nHis uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\\nUp-born with indefatigable wings\\nOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\\nThe happy Isle; what strength, what art can then\\nSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe\\nThrough the strict Sentries and Stations thick\\nOf Angels watching round? Here he had need\\nAll circumspection, and wee now no less\\nChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,\\nThe weight of all and our last hope relies.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis said, he sat; and expectation held\\nHis look suspense, awaiting who appeared\\nTo second, or oppose, or undertake\\nThe perilous attempt: but all sat mute,\\nPondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each\\nIn others countenance read his own dismay\\nAstonished: none among the choice and prime\\nOf those Heaven-warring Champions could be found\\nSo hardy as to proffer or accept\\nAlone the dreadful voyage; till at last\\n\\nSatan, whom now transcendent glory raised\\nAbove his fellows, with Monarchal pride\\nConscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake.\\n\\n\\n\\nO Progeny of Heaven, Imperial Thrones,\\nWith reason hath deep silence and demure\\nSeized us, though undismayed: long is the way\\nAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to light;\\nOur prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,\\nOutrageous to devour, immures us round\\nNinefold, and gates of burning Adamant\\nBarred over us prohibit all egress.\\nThese past, if any pass, the void profound\\nOf inessential Night receives him next\\nWide gaping, and with utter loss of being \\n\\nThreatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.\\nIf thence he escape into whatever world,\\nOr unknown Region, what remains him less\\nThen unknown dangers and as hard escape.\\nBut I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,\\nAnd this Imperial Sovereignty, adorned\\nWith splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed\\nAnd judged of public moment, in the shape\\nOf difficulty or danger could deter\\nMe  some copies have me  from  attempting. \\nWherefore do I assume\\nThese Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,\\nRefusing to accept as great a share\\nOf hazard as of honour, due alike\\nTo him who Reigns, and so much to him due\\nOf hazard more, as he above the rest\\nHigh honoured sits? Go therefore mighty Powers,\\nTerror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,\\nWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease\\nThe present misery, and render Hell\\nMore tolerable; if there be cure or charm\\nTo respite or deceive, or slack the pain\\nOf this ill Mansion: intermit no watch\\nAgainst a wakeful Foe, while I abroad\\nThrough all the Coasts of dark destruction seek\\nDeliverance for us all: this enterprise\\nNone shall partake with me.   Thus\\nsaying rose\\nThe Monarch, and prevented all reply,\\nPrudent, least from his resolution raised\\nOthers among the chief might offer now\\n(Certain to be refused) what erst they feared;\\nAnd so refused might in opinion stand\\nHis Rivals, winning cheap the high repute\\nWhich he through hazard huge must earn.  But they\\nDreaded not more the adventure then his voice\\n\\nForbidding; and at once with him they rose;\\nTheir rising all at once was as the sound\\nOf Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend\\nWith awful reverence prone; and as a God\\nExtol him equal to the highest in Heaven:\\nNor failed they to express how much they praised,\\nThat for the general safety he despised\\nHis own: for neither do the Spirits damned\\nLoose all her virtue; least bad men should boast\\nTheir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\\nOr close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.\\nThus they their doubtful consultations dark\\nEnded rejoicing in their matchless Chief:\\nAs when from mountain tops the dusky clouds\\nAscending, while the North wind sleeps, overspread\\nHeavens cheerful face, the lowering Element\\nScowls ore the darkened landscape Snow, or shower;\\nIf chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet\\nExtend his evening beam, the fields revive,\\nThe birds their notes renew, and bleating herds\\nAttest their joy, that hill and valley rings.\\nO shame to men! Devil with Devil damned\\nFirm concord holds, men only disagree\\nOf Creatures rational, though under hope\\nOf heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,\\nYet live in hatred, enmity, and strife\\nAmong themselves, and levy cruel wars,\\nWasting the Earth, each other to destroy:\\nAs if (which might induce us to accord)\\nMan had not hellish foes enough besides,\\nThat day and night for his destruction wait.\\n\\n\\nThe Stygian Counsel thus dissolved; and forth\\nIn order came the grand infernal Peers,\\nMidst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed \\n\\nAlone the Antagonist of Heaven, nor less\\nThan Hells dread Emperor with pomp Supreme,\\nAnd God-like imitated State; him round\\nA Globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed\\nWith bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.\\nThen of their Session ended they bid cry\\nWith Trumpets regal sound the great result:\\nToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\\nPut to their mouths the sounding Alchemy\\nBy Heralds voice explained: the hollow Abyss\\nHeard far and wide, and all the host of Hell\\nWith deafening shout, returned them loud acclaim.\\nThence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised\\nBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers\\nDisband, and wandering, each his several way\\nPursues, as inclination or sad choice\\nLeads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find\\nTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\\nThe irksome hours, till this great Chief return.\\nPart on the Plain, or in the Air sublime\\nUpon the wing, or in swift Race contend,\\nAs at theOlympian Games or Pythian fields;\\nPart curb their fiery Steeds, or shun the Goal\\nWith rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.\\nAs when to warn proud Cities war appears\\nWaged in the troubled Sky, and Armies rush\\nTo Battle in the Clouds, before each Van\\nPrick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch their Spears\\nTill thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms\\nFrom either end of Heaven the welkin burns.\\nOthers with vast Typh??an rage more fell\\nRend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air\\nIn whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.\\nAs when Alcides from Oechalia Crowned \\n\\nWith conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore\\nThrough pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,\\nAnd Lichas from the top of Oeta threw\\nInto theEuboic Sea.  Others more mild,\\nRetreated in a silent valley, sing\\nWith notes Angelical to many a Harp\\nTheir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall\\nBy doom of Battle; and complain that Fate\\nFree Virtue should enthral to Force or Chance.\\nTheir Song was partial, but the harmony\\n(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\\nSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment\\nThe thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet\\n(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)\\nOthers apart sat on a Hill retired,\\nIn thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high\\nOf Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,\\nFixed Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\\nAnd found no end, in wandering mazes lost.\\nOf good and evil much they argued then,\\nOf happiness and final misery,\\nPassion and Apathy, and glory and shame,\\nVain wisdom all, and false Philosophy:\\nYet with a pleasing sorcery could charm\\nPain for a while or anguish, and excite\\nFallacious hope, or arm the obdured breast\\nWith stubborn patience as with triple steel.\\nAnother part in Squadrons and gross Bands,\\nOn bold adventure to discover wide\\nThat dismal world, if any Clime perhaps\\nMight yield them easier habitation, bend\\nFour ways their flying March, along the Banks\\nOf four infernal Rivers that disgorge\\nInto the burning Lake their baleful streams; \\n\\nAbhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate,\\nSad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;\\n\\nCocytus, named of lamentation loud\\nHeard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton\\n\\nWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\\nFar off from these a slow and silent stream,\\n\\nLethe the River of Oblivion roules\\nHer watery Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,\\nForthwith his former state and being forgets,\\nForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\\nBeyond this flood a frozen Continent\\nLies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms\\nOf Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land\\nThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems\\nOf ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\\nA gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog\\nBetwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,\\nWhere Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air\\nBurns frore, and cold performs the effect of Fire.\\nThither by harpy-footed Furies hailed,\\nAt certain revolutions all the damned\\nAre brought: and feel by turns the bitter change\\nOf fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,\\nFrom Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice\\nTheir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine\\nImmovable, infixt, and frozen round,\\nPeriods of time, thence hurried back to fire.\\nThey ferry over this Lethean Sound\\nBoth to and fro, their sorrow to augment,\\nAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\\nThe tempting stream, with one small drop to loose\\nIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\\nAll in one moment, and so near the brink;\\nBut Fate  some copies have fate           withstands, and to oppose the attempt \\n\\n\\nMedusa with Gorgonian terror guards\\nThe Ford, and of it self the water flies\\nAll taste of living wight, as once it fled\\nThe lip of Tantalus.  Thus roving on\\nIn confused march forlorn, the adventrous Bands\\nWith shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast\\nViewed first their lamentable lot, and found\\nNo rest: through many a dark and dreary Veil\\nThey passed, and many a Region dolorous,\\nO'er many a Frozen, many a fiery Alpe,\\nRocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,\\nA Universe of death, which God by curse\\nCreated evil, for evil only good,\\nWhere all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,\\nPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,\\nAbominable, unutterable, and worse\\nThan Fables yet have feigned, or fear conceived,\\n\\nGorgons and Hydra's, and \\nChimera's dire.\\n\\n\\nMean while the Adversary of God and Man,\\n\\nSatan with thoughts inflamed of highest design,\\nPuts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell\\nExplores his solitary flight; some times\\nHe scours the right hand coast, some times the left,\\nNow shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars\\nUp to the fiery Concave touring high.\\nAs when far off at Sea a Fleet descried\\nHangs in the Clouds, by ??quinoctial Winds\\nClose sailing from Bengala, or the Isles\\nOf Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring\\nTheir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood\\nThrough the wide Ethiopian to the Cape\\nPly stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seemed\\nFar off the flying Fiend: at last appear\\nHell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, \\n\\nAnd thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass,\\nThree Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\\nImpenetrable, impaled with circling fire,\\nYet unconsumed.  Before the Gates there sat\\nOn either side a formidable shape;\\nThe one seemed Woman to the waste, and fair,\\nBut ended foul in many a scaly fouled\\nVoluminous and vast, a Serpent armed\\nWith mortal sting: about her middle round\\nA cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing barked\\nWith wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung\\nA hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\\nIf aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,\\nAnd kennel there, yet there still barked and howled,\\nWithin unseen.  Far less abhorred than these\\nVexed Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts\\n\\nCalabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:\\nNor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when called\\nIn secret, riding through the Air she comes\\nLured with the smell of infant blood, to dance\\nWith Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon\\nEclipses at their charms.  The other shape,\\nIf shape it might be called that shape had none\\nDistinguishable in member, joint, or limb,\\nOr substance might be called that shadow seemed,\\nFor each seemed either; black it stood as Night,\\nFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\\nAnd shook a dreadful Dart; what seemed his head\\nThe likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\\n\\nSatan was now at hand, and from his seat\\nThe Monster moving onward came as fast\\nWith horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\\nThe undaunted Fiend what this might be admired, Admired, not feared;\\nGod and his Son except, \\n\\nCreated thing nought valued he nor shunned;\\nAnd with disdainful look thus first began.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhence and what art thou, execrable shape,\\nThat dare, though grim and terrible, advance\\nThy miscreated Front athwart my way\\nTo yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\\nThat be assured, without leave asked of thee:\\nRetire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\\nHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo whom the Goblin full of wrath replied,\\n\\nArt thou that Traitor Angel, art thou he,\\nWho first broke peace in Heaven and Faith, till then\\nUnbroken, and in proud rebellious Arms\\nDrew after him the third part of Heavens Sons\\nConjured against the highest, for which both Thou\\nAnd they outcast from God, are here condemned\\nTo waste Eternal days  some copies have days  in woe and pain?\\nAnd reckons thou thy self with Spirits of Heaven,\\nHell-doomed, and breath defiance here and scorn\\nWhere I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\\nThy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,\\nFalse fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,\\nLeast with a whip of Scorpions I pursue\\nThy lingering, or with one stroke of this Dart\\nStrange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo spake the grisly terror, and in shape,\\nSo speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold\\nMore dreadful and deform: on the other side\\nIncensed  some copies have Licenced with indignation Satan stood\\nUnterrifi'd, and like a Comet burned,\\nThat fires the length of Ophiucus huge\\nIn the Arctic Sky, and from his horrid hair\\nShakes Pestilence and War. Each at the Head\\nLeveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands \\n\\n\\nNo second stroke intend, and such a frown\\nEach cast at the other, as when two black Clouds\\nWith Heavens Artillery fraught, come rattling on\\nOver the Caspian, then stand front to front\\nHovering a space, till Winds the signal blow\\nTo join their dark Encounter in mid air:\\nSo frowned the mighty Combatants, that Hell\\nGrew darker at their frown, so matched they stood;\\nFor never but once more was either like\\nTo meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\\nHad been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,\\nHad not the Snaky Sorceress that sat\\nFast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,\\nRisen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.\\n\\n\\n\\nO Father, what intends thy hand, \\nshe  cried,\\n\\nAgainst thy only Son? What fury O Son,\\nPossesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\\nAgainst thy Fathers head? and know for whom;\\nFor him who sits above and laughs the while\\nAt thee ordained his drudge, to execute\\nWhat ever his wrath, which he calls justice, bids,\\nHis wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe spake, and at her words the hellish Pest\\nForbore, then these to her Satan returned:\\n\\n\\n\\nSo strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\\nThou interposes, that my sudden hand\\nPrevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\\nWhat it intends; till first I know of thee,\\nWhat thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why\\nIn this infernal Veil first met thou call\\nMe Father, and that Phantasm call my Son?\\nI know thee not, nor ever saw till now\\nSight more detestable then him and thee. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate replied;\\n\\nhas thou forgot me then, and do I seem\\nNow in thine eyes so foul, once deemed so fair\\nIn Heaven, when at The Assembly, and in sight\\nOf all the Seraphim with thee combined\\nIn bold conspiracy against Heavens King,\\nAll on a sudden miserable pain\\nSurprised thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzy swum\\nIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\\nThrew forth, till on the left side opening wide,\\nLikest to thee in shape and countenance bright,\\nThen shining heavenly fair, a Goddess armed\\nOut of thy head I sprung: amazement seized\\nAll the Host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid\\nAt first, and called me Sin, and for a Sign\\nPortentous held me; but familiar grown,\\nI pleased, and with attractive graces won\\nThe most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft\\nThy self in me thy perfect image viewing\\nBecame enamoured, and such joy thou took\\nWith me in secret, that my womb conceived\\nA growing burden.  Mean while War arose,\\nAnd fields were fought in Heaven; wherein remained\\n(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe\\nClear Victory, to our part loss and rout\\nThrough all the Empyrean: down they fell\\nDriven headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down\\nInto this Deep, and in the general fall\\nI also; at which time this powerful Key\\nInto my hand was given, with charge to keep\\nThese Gates for ever shut, which none can pass\\nWithout my opening.  Pensive here I sat\\nAlone, but long I sat not, till my womb \\n\\n\\nPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown\\nProdigious motion felt and rueful throes.\\nAt last this odious offspring whom thou see\\nThine own begotten, breaking violent way\\nTore through my entrails, that with fear and pain\\nDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew\\nTransformed: but he my inbred enemy\\nForth issued, brandishing his fatal Dart\\nMade to destroy: I fled, and cried out Death;\\nHell trembled at the hideous Name, and sighed\\nFrom all her Caves, and back resounded Death.\\nI fled, but he pursued (though more, it seems,\\nInflamed with lust then rage) and swifter far,\\nMe overtook his mother all dismayed,\\nAnd in embraces forcible and foul\\nEngendering with me, of that rape begot\\nThese yelling Monsters that with ceaseless cry\\nSurround me, as thou saw, hourly conceived\\nAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite\\nTo me, for when they list into the womb\\nThat bred them they return, and howl and gnaw\\nMy Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth\\nA fresh with conscious terrors vex me round,\\nThat rest or intermission none I find.\\nBefore mine eyes in opposition sits\\nGrim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on,\\nAnd me his Parent would full soon devour\\nFor want of other prey, but that he knows\\nHis end with mine involved; and knows that I\\nShould prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,\\nWhen ever that shall be; so Fate pronounced.\\nBut thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun\\nHis deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\\nTo be invulnerable in those bright Arms,\\n\\nThough tempered heavenly, for that mortal dint,\\nSave he who reigns above, none can resist.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe finished, and the subtle Fiend his lore\\nSoon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth.\\n\\nDear Daughter, since thou clammiest me for thy Sire,\\nAnd my fair Son here shows me, the dear pledge\\nOf dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys\\nThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change\\nBefallen us unforeseen, unthought of, know\\nI come no enemy, but to set free\\nFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain,\\nBoth him and thee, and all the heavenly Host\\nOf Spirits that in our just pretences armed\\nFell with us from on high: from them I go\\nThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all\\nMy self expose, with lonely steps to tread\\nThe unfounded deep, and through the void immense\\nTo search with wandering quest a place foretold\\nShould be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\\nCreated vast and round, a place of bliss\\nIn the Purlieus of Heaven, and therein placed\\nA race of upstart Creatures, to supply\\nPerhaps our vacant room, though more removed,\\nLeast Heaven surcharged with potent multitude\\nMight hap to move new broils: Be this or aught\\nThen this more secret now designed, I haste\\nTo know, and this once known, shall soon return,\\nAnd bring ye to the place where Thou and Death\\nShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\\nWing silently the buxom Air, embalmed\\nWith odours; there ye shall be fed and filled\\nImmeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\\n\\nHe ceased, for both seemed highly pleased, and Death\\nGrinnd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear \\n\\n\\nHis famine should be filled, and blessed his maw\\nDestined to that good hour: no less rejoiced\\nHis mother bad, and thus bespoke her Sire.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe key of this infernal Pit by due,\\nAnd by command of Heavens all-powerful King\\nI keep, by him forbidden to unlock\\nThese Adamantine Gates; against all force\\nDeath ready stands to interpose his dart,\\nFearless to be overmatched by living might.\\nBut what ow I to his commands above\\nWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\\nInto this gloom of Tartarus profound,\\nTo sit in hateful Office here confined,\\nInhabitant of Heaven, and heavenly-born,\\nHere in perpetual agony and pain,\\nWith terrors and with clamours compassed round\\nOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:\\nThou art my Father, thou my Author, thou\\nMy being gave me; whom should I obey\\nBut thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon\\nTo that new world of light and bliss, among\\nThe Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign\\nAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\\nThy daughter and thy darling, without end.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus saying, from her side the fatal Key,\\nSad instrument of all our woe, she took;\\nAnd towards the Gate rolling her bestial train,\\nForthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,\\nWhich but her self not all the Stygian powers\\nCould once have moved; then in the key-hole turns\\nThunderstorm wards, and every Bolt and Bar\\nOf massy Iron or solid Rock with ease\\nUnfastens: on a sudden open fly\\nWith impetuous recoil and jarring sound \\n\\nThe infernal doors, and on their hinges grate\\nHarsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\\nOf Erebus.  She opened, but to shut\\nExcelled her power; the Gates wide open stood,\\nThat with extended wings a Bannered Host\\nUnder spread Ensigns marching might pass through\\nWith Horse and Chariots ranked in loose array;\\nSo wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth\\nCast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.\\nBefore their eyes in sudden view appear\\nThe secrets of the hoary deep, a dark\\nIllimitable Ocean without bound,\\nWithout dimension, where length, breadth, & height,\\nAnd time and place are lost; where eldest Night\\nAnd Chaos.  Ancestors of Nature, hold\\nEternal Anarchy, amidst the noise\\nOf endless Wars, and by confusion stand.\\nFor hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce\\nStrive here for Maistrie, and to Battle bring\\nTheir embryon Atoms; they around the flag\\nOf each his Faction, in their several Clanns,\\nLight-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,\\nSwarm populous, unnumbered as the Sands\\nOf Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,\\nLevied to side with warring Winds, and poise\\nTheir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,\\nHe rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,\\nAnd by decision more embroils the fray\\nBy which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter\\n\\nChance governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,\\nThe Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,\\nOf neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,\\nBut all these in their pregnant causes mixed\\nConfusedly, and which thus must ever fight, \\n\\n\\nUnless the almighty Maker them ordain\\nHis dark materials to create more Worlds,\\nInto this wild Abyss the wary fiend\\nStood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,\\nPondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith\\nHe had to cross.  Nor was his ear less pealed\\nWith noises loud and ruinous (to compare\\nGreat things with small) then when Bellona storms,\\nWith all her battering Engines bent to raise\\nSome Capital City; or less then if this frame\\nOf Heaven were falling, and these Elements\\nIn mutiny had from her Axle torn\\nThe steadfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes\\nHe spreads for flight, and in the surging smoke\\nUplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League\\nAs in a cloudy Chair ascending rides\\nAudacious, but that seat soon failing, meets\\nA vast vacuity: all unawares\\nFluttering his pennons vain plumb down he drops\\nTen thousand fathom deep, and to this hour\\nDown had been falling, had not by ill chance\\nThe strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud\\nInstinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him\\nAs many miles aloft: that fury stayed,\\nQuenched in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,\\nNor good dry Land: nigh foundered on he fares,\\nTreading the crude consistency, half on foot,\\nHalf flying; behoves him now both Oar and Sail.\\nAs when a Griffin through the Wilderness\\nWith winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,\\nPursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth\\nHad from his wakeful custody purloined\\nThe guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend\\nOre bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\\n\\nWith head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way,\\nAnd swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies:\\nAt length a universal hubbub wilde\\nOf stunning sounds and voices all confused\\nBorn through the hollow dark assaults his ear\\nWith loudest vehemence: thither he plies,\\nUndaunted to meet there what ever power\\nOr Spirit of the nethermost Abyss\\nMight in that noise reside, of whom to ask\\nWhich way the nearest coast of darkness lies\\nBordering on light; when strait behold the Throne\\nOf Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread\\nWide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthroned\\nSat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,\\nThe Consort of his Reign; and by them stood\\n\\nOrcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\\nOf Demogorgon; Rumour next and Chance,\\nAnd Tumult and Confusion all embroiled,\\nAnd Discord with a thousand various mouths.\\n\\n\\nThey whom Satan turning boldly, thus.\\n Ye Powers\\nAnd Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,\\n\\nChaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy,\\nWith purpose to explore or to disturb\\nThe secrets of your Realm, but by constraint\\nWandering this darksome Desert, as my way,\\nLies through your spacious Empire up to light,\\nAlone, and without guide, half lost, I seek\\nWhat readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds\\nConfine with Heaven; or if some other place\\nFrom your Dominion won, the Ethereal King\\nPossesses lately, thither to arrive\\nI travel this profound, direct my course;\\nDirected no mean recompense it brings\\nTo your behoof, if I that Region lost, \\n\\nAll usurpation thence expelled, reduce\\nTo her original darkness and your sway\\n(Which is my present journey) and once more\\nErect the Standard there of ancient Night;\\nYours be the advantage all, mine the revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old\\nWith faltering speech and visage incompos'd\\nAnswered.  I know thee, stranger,\\nwho thou art,\\nThat mighty leading Angel, who of late\\nMade head against Heavens King, though overthrown.\\nI saw and heard, for such a numerous Host\\nFled not in silence through the frighted deep\\nWith ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,\\nConfusion worse confounded; and Heaven Gates\\nPoured out by millions her victorious Bands\\nPursuing.  I upon my Frontiers here\\nKeep residence; if all I can will serve,\\nThat little which is left so to defend,\\nEncroached on still through our intestine broils\\nWeakening the Sceptre of old Night: first Hell\\nYour dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;\\nNow lately Heaven and Earth, another World\\nHung ore my Realm, linked in a golden Chain\\nTo that side Heaven from whence your Legions fell:\\nIf that way be your walk, you have not far;\\nSo much the nearer danger; go and speed;\\nHavoc and spoil and ruin are my gain.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe ceased; and Satan staid not to reply,\\nBut glad that now his Sea should find a shore,\\nWith fresh alacrity and force renewed\\nSprings upward like a Pyramid of fire\\nInto the wilde expanse, and through the shock\\nOf fighting Elements, on all sides round\\nEnvironed wins his way; harder beset \\n\\nAnd more endangered, then when Argo passed\\nThrough Bosporus betwixt the jostling Rocks:\\nOr when Ulysses on the Larbord shunned\\n\\nCharybdis, and by the other whirlpool steered.\\nSo he with difficulty and labour hard\\nMoved on, with difficulty and labour he;\\nBut he once past, soon after when man fell,\\nStrange alteration! Sin and Death amain\\nFollowing his track, such was the will of Heaven,\\nPaved after him a broad and beaten way\\nOver the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf\\nTamely endured a Bridge of wondrous length\\nFrom Hell continued reaching th'utmost Orb\\nOf this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse\\nWith easy intercourse pass to and fro\\nTo tempt or punish mortals, except whom\\nGod and good Angels guard by special grace.\\nBut now at last the sacred influence\\nOf light appears, and from the walls of Heaven\\nShoots far into the bosom of dim Night\\nA glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins\\nHer farthest verge, and Chaos to retire\\nAs from her outmost works a brok'd foe\\nWith tumult less and with less hostile din,\\nThat Satan with less toil, and now with ease\\nWafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\\nAnd like a weather-beaten Vessel holds\\nGladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;\\nOr in the emptier waste, resembling Air,\\nWeighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold\\nFar off the Empyreal Heaven, extended wide\\nIn circuit, undetermined square or round,\\nWith Opal Towers and Battlements adorned\\nOf living Sapphire, once his native Seat; \\n\\nAnd fast by hanging in a golden Chain\\nThis pendant world, in bigness as a Star\\nOf smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.\\nThither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\\nAccursed, and in a cursed hour he hies.\\nThe End of the Second Book.\\n\\n\""
