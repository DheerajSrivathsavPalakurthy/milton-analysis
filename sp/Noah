                  Servant of Servants, on his vicious Race.
               Thus will this latter, as the former World,
               Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
               Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
               His presence from among them, and avert
               His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
               To leave them to their own polluted ways;
               And one peculiar Nation to select
               From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,
               A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
               Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
               Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
               (Can thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
               While yet the Patriarch lived, who escaped the Flood,
               As to forsake the living God, and fall
               To worship their own work in Wood and Stone
               For Gods! yet him God the most High vouchsafed
               To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
               His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
               Which he will show him, and from him will raise
               A mighty Nation, and upon him shower
               His benediction so, that in his Seed
               All Nations shall be blessed; he straight obeys,
               Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
               I see him, but thou can not, with what Faith
               He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soil
               
                  Ur of Chald??a, passing now the Ford
               
               To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train
               Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
               Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth
               With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
               
                  Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents
               Pitched about Sachem, and the neighbouring Plain
               Of Moreh; there by promise he receives
               Gift to his Progeny of all that Land;
               From Hamath Northward to the Desert South
               (Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed)
               From Hormone East to the great Western Sea,
               Mount Hormone, yonder Sea, each place behold
               In prospect, as I point them; on the shore
               Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream
               
                  Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
               Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills.
               This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
               Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
               Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
               The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
               Plainlier shall be reveled.  This Patriarch blessed,
               Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
               A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
               Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
               The Grandchild with twelve Sons increased, departs
               From Canaan, to a Land hereafter called
               
                  Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
               See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths
               Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
               He comes invited by a younger Son
               In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
               Raise him to be the second in that Realm
               Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race
               
               Growing into a Nation, and now grown
               Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
               To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
               Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
               Inhospitably, and kills their infant Males:
               Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
               
                  Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim
               His people from enthralling, they return
               With glory and spoil back to their promised Land.
               But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
               To know their God, or message to regard,
               Must be compelled by Signs and Judgements dire;
               To blood unshed the Rivers must be turned,
               Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
               With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;
               His Cattle must of Rot and Murren die,
               Botches and blaines must all his flesh emboss,
               And all his people; Thunder mixed with Hail,
               Hail mixed with fire must rend theEgyptian Sky
               And wheel on the Earth, devouring where it rolls;
               What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Grain,
               A darksome Cloud of Locusts swarming down
               Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
               Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
               Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;
               Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
               Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
               The River-dragon tamed at length submits
               To let his sojourners depart, and oft
               Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
               More hardened after thaw, till in his rage
               Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the Sea
               Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass
               
               As on dry land between two crystal walls,
               Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
               Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
               Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
               Though present in his Angel, who shall go
               Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
               By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire,
               To guide them in their journey, and remove
               Behind them, while the obdurate King pursues:
               All night he will pursue, but his approach
               Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
               Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
               God looking forth will trouble all his Host
               And craze their Chariot wheels: when by command
               
                  Moses once more his potent Rod extends
               Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
               On their embattled ranks the Waves return,
               And overwhelm their War: the Race elect
               Safe towards Canaan from the shore advance
               Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
               Least entering on the Canaanite alarmed
               War terrify them inexpert, and fear
               Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
               Inglorious life with servitude; for life
               To noble and ignoble is more sweet
               Untraind in Arms, where rashness leads not on.
               This also shall they gain by their delay
               In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
               Their government, and their great Senate choose
               Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordained:
               God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top
               Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
               In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound
                  
               
               Ordain them Laws; part such as appertain
               To civil Justice, part religious Rites
               Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
               And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
               The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
               Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
               To mortal ear is dreadful; they beseech
               That Moses might report to them his will,
               And terror cease; he grants what they besought
               Instructed that to God is no access
               Without Mediator, whose high Office now
               
                  Moses in figure bears, to introduce
               One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
               And all the Prophets in their Age the times
               Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites
               Established, such delight hath God in Men
               Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafed
               Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
               The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
               By his prescription a Sanctuary is framed
               Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
               An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
               The Records of his Covenant, over these
               A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
               Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
               Seven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
               The Heavenly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
               Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleam by Night,
               Save when they journey, and at length they come,
               Conducted by his Angel to the Land
               Promised to Abraham and his Seed: the rest
               Were long to tell, how many Battles fought,
               How many Kings destroyed, and Kingdoms won,
               
               Or how the Sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
               A day entire, and Nights due course adjourn,
               Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,
               And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon,
               Till Israel overcome; so call the third
               From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him
               His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
