               
            
            
               O Prince, O Chief of many Droned Powers,
               That led the embattled Seraphim to War
               Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
               Fearless, endangered Heavens perpetual King;
               And put to proof his sigh Supremacy,
               Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
               Too well I see and rue the dire event,
               That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
               Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty Host
               In horrible destruction laid thus low,
               As far as Gods and Heavenly Essences
               Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
               Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
               Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state
               Here swallowed up in endless misery.
               But what if he our Conqueror, (whom I now
               Of force believe Almighty, since no less
               Then such could have overpowerd such force as ours)
               Have left us this our spirit and strength entire
               Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
               That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
               Or do him mightier service as his thralls
                  
               
               By right of War, what ever his business be
               Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
               Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
               What can it then avail though yet we feel
               Strength undiminished, or eternal being
               To undergo eternal punishment?
               
                  
 Leader of those
Armies bright,
               Which but the Omnipotent none could have foiled,
               If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge
               Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft
               In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge
               Of battle when it raged, in all assaults
               Their surest signal, they will soon resume
               New courage and revive, though now they lye
               Grovelling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,
               As we meanwhile, astounded and amazed,
               No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height.
               
                  

               
            
            
               Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of  heaven
               Ethereal Virtues; or these Titles now
               Must we renounce, and changing stile be called
               Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
               Inclines, here to continue, and build up here
               A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,
               And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
               This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
               Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt
               From Heavens high jurisdiction, in new League
               Banded against his Throne, but to remain
               In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,
               Under the inevitable curb, reserved
               His captive multitude: For he, be sure
               In height or depth, still first and last will Reign
               Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part
               By our revolt, but over Hell extend
               His Empire, and with Iron Sceptre rule
               Us here, as with his Golden those in Heaven.
               What sit we then projecting peace and War?
               War hath determined us, and foiled with loss
               Irreparable; terms of peace yet none
               Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given
               To us enslaved, but custody severe,
               And stripes, and arbitrary punishment
               Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
               But to our power hostility and hate,
               Untamed reluctance, and revenge though slow,
               Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least 
               
               May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice
               In doing what we most in suffering feel?
               Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
               With dangerous expedition to invade
               Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,
               Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find
               Some easier enterprise? There is a place
               (if ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
               Err not) another World, the happy seat
               Of some new Race called Man, about this time
               To be created like to us, though less
               In power and excellence, but favoured more
               Of him who rules above; so was his will
               Pronounced among the Gods, and by an Oath,
               That shook Heavens whole circumference, confirmed.
               Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
               What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,
               Or substance, how endued, and what their Power,
               And where their weakness, how attempted best,
               By force or subtlety: Though Heaven be shut,
               And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
               In his own strength, this place may lye exposed
               The utmost border of his Kingdom, left
               To their defence who hold it: here perhaps
               Some advantageous act may be achieved
               By sudden onset, either with Hell fire
               To waste his whole Creation, or possess
               All as our own, and drive as we were driven,
               The puny habitants, or if not drive,
               Seduce them to our Party, that their God
               May prove their foe, and with repenting hand
               Abolish his own works.  This would surpass
               Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
               In our Confusion, and our joy upraise 
                  
               
               In his disturbance; when his darling Sons
               Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse
               Their frail Original, and faded bliss,
               Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth
               Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
               Hatching vain Empires. 

               
            
            
               Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,
               Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,
               Great things resolved; which from the lowest deep
               Will once more lift us up, in spite of Fate,
               Nearer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view
               Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms
               And opportune excursion we may chance
               Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild Zone
               Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair Light
               Secure, and at the brightening Orient beam
               Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,
               To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires
               Shall breathe her balm.  But first whom shall we send
               In search of this new world, whom shall we find
               Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet
               The dark unbottomed infinite Abyss
               And through the palpable obscure find out 
               
               His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight
               Up-born with indefatigable wings
               Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
               The happy Isle; what strength, what art can then
               Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe
               Through the strict Sentries and Stations thick
               Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
               All circumspection, and wee now no less
               Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,
               The weight of all and our last hope relies.
