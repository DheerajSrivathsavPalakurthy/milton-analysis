 Fair Angel, thy desire which tends
to know
               The works of God, thereby to glorify 
               
               The great workmaster, leads to no excess
               That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
               The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
               From thy Imperial Mansion thus alone,
               To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
               Contented with report hear only in heaven:
               For wonderful indeed are all his works,
               Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
               Had in remembrance always with delight;
               But what created mind can comprehend
               Their number, or the wisdom infinite
               That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep.
               I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,
               This worlds material mould, came to a heap:
               
                  Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar
               Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;
               Till at his second bidding darkness fled,
               Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:
               Swift to their several Quarters hasted then
               The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Air, Fire,
               And this Ethereal quintessence of Heaven
               Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
               That rolled orbicular, and turned to Stars
               Numberless, as thou see, and how they move;
               Each had his place appointed, each his course,
               The rest in circuit walls this Universe.
               Look downward on that Globe whose hither side
               With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
               That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light
               His day, which else as the other Hemisphere
               Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon
               (So call that opposite fair Star) her aide
               Timely interposes, and her monthly round
               Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven; 
                  
               
               With borrowed light her countenance triform
               Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,
               And in her pale dominion checks the night.
               That spot to which I point is Paradise,
               
                  Adams abode, those lofty shades his Bower.
               Thy way thou can not miss, me mine requires.

               
            
            
               
                  Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath given
               Charge and strict watch that to this happy Place 
               
               No evil thing approach or enter in;
               This day at height of Noon came to my Sphere
               A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know
               More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man
               Gods latest Image: I described his way
               Bent all on speed, and marked his Aerie Gate;
               But in the Mount that lies from Eden North,
               Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks
               Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:
               Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade
               Lost sight of him; one of the banished crew
               I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise
               New troubles; him thy care must be to find.
