               
               Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
               Or undiminished brightness, to be known
               As when thou stood in Heaven upright and pure;
               That Glory then, when thou no more was good,
               Departed from thee, and thou resembles now
               Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.
               But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
               To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
               This place inviolable, and these from harm.
 Thy fear,
