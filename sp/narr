OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
               Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste
               Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
               With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
               Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
               Sing Heavenly Muse, that on the secret top
               Of Oreb, or of Sinai, did inspire
               That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
               In the Beginning how the Heavens and Earth
               Rose out of Chaos: Or if Zion Hill
               Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flowed
               Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
               Invoke thy aid to my adventurous Song,
                  
               
               That with no middle flight intends to soar
               Above the Aonian Mount, while it pursues
               Things undignified yet in Prose or Rhyme.
               And chiefly Thou, some copies omit the  commaO
Spirit, that does prefer
               Before all Temples the upright heart and pure,
               Instruct me, for Thou know; Thou from the first
               Was present, and with mighty wings outspread
               Dove-like sat brooding on the vast Abyss
               And made it pregnant: What in me is dark
               Illuminates, what is low raise and support;
               That to the height of this great Argument
               I may assert Eternal Providence,
               And justify the ways of God to men.
            
            
               Say first, for Heaven hides nothing from thy view
               Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause
               Moved our Grand Parents in that happy State,
               Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off
               From their Creator, and transgress his Will
               For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?
               Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
               The infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile
               Stirred up with Envy and Revenge, deceived
               The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride
               Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his Host
               Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
               To set himself in Glory above his Peers,
               He trusted to have equalled the most High,
               If he opposed; and with ambitious aim
               Against the Throne and Monarchy of God
               Raised impious War in Heaven and Battle proud
               With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power
               Hurled headlong flaming from the Ethereal Sky
               With hideous ruin and combustion down
               To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
               
               In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,
               Who dared defy the Omnipotent to Arms.
               Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night
               To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
               Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery Gulf
               Confounded though immortal: But his doom
               Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
               Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
               Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
               That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
               Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
               At once as far as Angels ken he views
               The dismal Situation waste and wilde,
               A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round
               As one great Furnace flamed, yet from those flames
               No light, but rather darkness visible
               Served only to discover sights of woe,
               Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
               And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
               That comes to all; but torture without end
               Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed
               With ever-burning Sulphur unconsumed:
               Such place Eternal Justice had prepared
               For those rebellious, here their some copies  print
their  Prison ordained
               In utter darkness, and their portion set
               As far removed from God and light of Heaven
               As from the Center thrice to the utmost Pole.
               O how unlike the place from whence they fell!
               There the companions of his fall, overwhelmed
               With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
               He soon discerns, and weltering by his side
               One next himself in power, and next in crime,
               Long after known in Palestine, and named
               
                  Beelzebub.  To whom the Arch-Enemy,
                  
               
               And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold  words
               Breaking the horrid silence thus began.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So spake the Apostate Angel, though in pain,
               Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair:
               And him thus answered soon his bold Comfier.
               
                  
 Where to with speedy words the
Arch-fiend replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               Thus Satan to his nearest Mate
               With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes
               That sparkling blazed, his other Parts besides
               Prone on the Flood, extended long and large
               Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
               As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,
               
                  Titanian, or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,
               
                  Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den
               By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast
               
                  Leviathan, which God of all his works
               Created hugest that swim the Ocean stream:
               Him happily slumbering on the Norway foam
               The Pilot of some small night-foundered Skiff,
               Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,
               With fixed Anchor in his scaly rind
               Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night
               Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delays:
               So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
               Chained on the burning Lake, nor ever thence
               Had risen or heaved his head, but that the will
               And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
               Left him at large to his own dark designs,
               That with reiterated crimes he might
               Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
               Evil to others, and enraged might see
               How all his malice served but to bring forth
               
               Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shown
               On Man by him seduced, but on himself
               Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance poured.
               Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool
               His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames
               Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled
               In billows, leave in the midst a horrid Vale.
               Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
               Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air
               That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land
               He lights, if it were Land that ever burned
               With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;
               And such appeared in hue, as when the force
               Of subterranean wind transports a Hill
               Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side
               Of thundering Aetna, whose combustible
               And fuelled entrails thence conceiving Fire,
               Sublimed with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,
               And leave a singed bottom all involved
               With stench and smoke: Such resting found the sole
               Of unblessed feet.  Him followed his next Mate,
               Both glorying to have escaped the Stygian flood
               As Gods, and by their own recovered strength,
               Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub
               
               Thus answered. 

               
            
            
               He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend
               Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield
               Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,
               
               Behind him cast; the broad circumference
               Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb
               Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views
               At Evening from the top of Fesole,
               Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,
               Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.
               His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine
               Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast
               Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,
               He walked with to support uneasy steps
               Over the burning Marle, not like those steps
               On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime
               Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;
               Nathless he so endured, till on the Beach
               Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and called
               His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay entranced
               Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strew the Brooks
               In Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades
               High overarched imbowr; or scattered sedge
               Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion armed
               Hath vexed the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves overthrew
               
                  Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry,
               While with perfidious hatred they pursued
               The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
               From the safe shore their floating Carcasses
               And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown
               Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,
               Under amazement of their hideous change.
               He called so loud, that all the hollow Deep
               Of Hell resounded. 

               
            
            
               They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung
               Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
               On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
               Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
               Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
               In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
               Yet to their Generals Voice they soon obeyed
               Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod
               Of Amrams Son in Egypt evil day
               Waved round the Coast, up called a pitchy cloud
               Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,
               That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung
               Like Night, and darkened all the Land of Nile:
               So numberless were those bad Angels seen
               Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell
               Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;
               Till, as a signal given, the uplifted Spear
               Of their great Sultan waving to direct
               Their course, in even balance down they light
               On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;
               A multitude, like which the populous North
               Poured never from her frozen loins, to pass
               
                  Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons
               
               Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread
               Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.
               Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band
               The Heads and Leaders thither has where stood
               Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms
               Excelling human, Princely Dignities,
               And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on Thrones;
               Though of their Names in heavenly Records now
               Be no memorial blotted out and rased
               By their Rebellion, from the Books of Life.
               Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve
               
               Got them new Names, till wandering ore the Earth,
               Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man,
               By falsities and lies the greatest part
               Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake
               God their Creator, and the invisible
               Glory of him that made them, to transform
               Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorned
               With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,
               And Devils to adore for Deities:
               Then were they known to men by various Names,
               And various Idols through the Heathen World.
               Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,
               Roused from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,
               At their great Emperors call, as next in worth
               Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
               While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
               The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell
               Roaming to seek their prey on earth, dared fix
               Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,
               Their Altars by his Altar, Gods adored
               Among the Nations round, and dared abide
               
                  Jehovah thundering out of Zion, throned
               Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed
               
               Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,
               Abominations; and with cursed things
               His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profaned,
               And with their darkness dared affront his light.
               First Moloch, horrid King besmeared with blood
               Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
               Though for the noise of Drums and Timbrels loud
               Their children's cries unheard, that past through fire
               To his grim Idol.  Him the Ammonite
               
               Worshipped in Rabba and her watery Plain,
               In Argob and in Basan, to the stream 
               Of utmost Arnon.  Not content with such
               Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
               Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
               His Temple right against the Temple of God
               On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
               The pleasant Valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence
               And black Gehenna called, the Type of Hell.
               Next Chemos, the obscene dread of Moabs Sons,
               From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
               Of Southernmost Abarim; in Hesebon
               
               And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond
               The flowery Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,
               And Eleale to the Asphaltick Pool.
               
                  Peor his other Name, when he enticed
               
                  Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile
               
               To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
               Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarged
               Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
               Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;
               Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
               With these came they, who from the bordring flood
               Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts
               
                  Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names
               
               Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,
               These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please
               Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft
               And uncompounded is their Essence pure,
               Not tied or manacled with joint or limb,
               Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
               Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose
               Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,
               Can execute their aerie purposes,
               And works of love or enmity fulfil.
               For those the Race of Israel oft forsook
               Their living strength, and unfrequented left
               His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down
               To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low
               Bowed down in Battle, sunk before the Spear
               Of despicable foes.  With these in troop
               Came Astoreth, whom the Ph??nicians called
               
                  Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent Horns;
               To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon
               
                  Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,
               In Zion also not unsung, where stood
               Her Temple on the offensive Mountain, built
               By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,
               Beguiled by fair Idolatresses, fell
               To Idols foul.  Thammuz came next behind,
               Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
               The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate
               In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,
               While smooth Adonis from his native Rock
               Ran purple to the Sea, supposed with blood
               Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale
               Infected Sions daughters with like heat,
               Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch
               
                  Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led
               
               His eye surveyed the dark Idolatries
               Of alienated Judah.  Next came one
               Who mourned in earnest, when the Captive Ark
               Maimed his brute Image, head and hands lopped off
               In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,
               Where he fell flat, and shamed his Worshippers:
               
                  Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man
               And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high
               Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast
               Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon
               
               And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
               Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat
               Was fair Damascus, on the fertile Banks
               Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
               He also against the house of God was bold:
               A Leper once he lost and gained a King,
               
                  Ahaz his sottish Conqueror, whom he drew
               Gods Altar to disparage and displace
               For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
               His odious offerings, and adore the Gods
               Whom he had vanquished.  After these appeared
               A crew who under Names of old Renown,
               
                  Osiris, Isis, Orus and their
 some copies have their  Train
               With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
               Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek
               Their wandering Gods disguised in brutish forms
               Rather then human.  Nor did Israel escape
               The infection when their borrowed Gold composed
               The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King
               Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
               Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,
               
                  Jehovah, who in one Night when he passed
               From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
               Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. 
                  
               
               
                  Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd
               Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
               Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood
               Or Altar smoked; yet who more oft then he
               In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest
               Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who filled
               With lust and violence the house of God.
               In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns
               And in luxurious Cities, where the noise
               Of riot ascends above their  some copies have  theirloftiest Towers,
               And injury and outrage: And when Night
               Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons
               Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
               Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night
               In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
               Exposed a Matron to avoid worse rape.
               These were the prime in order and in might;
               The rest were long to tell, though far renowned,
               The Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held
               Gods, yet confessed later then Heaven and Earth
               Their boasted Parents; Titan Heavens first born
               With his enormous brood, and birthright seized
               By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove
               
               His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;
               So Jove usurping reigned: these first in Create
               
               And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top
               Of cold Olympus ruled the middle Air
               Their highest Heaven; or on the Delphian Cliff,
               Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
               Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old
               Fled over Atria to the Hesperian Fields,
               And ore the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. 
               All these and more came flocking; but with looks
               Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appeared
               
               Obscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their chief
               Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
               In loss itself; which on his countenance cast
               Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride
               Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
               Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
               Their fencing courage, and dispel'd their fears.
               Then strait commands that at the warlike sound
               Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard
               His mighty Standard; that proud honour claimed
               
                  Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:
               Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurled
               The Imperial Ensign, which full high advanced
               Shone like a Meteor streaming to the Wind
               With Gems and Golden lustre rich emblazed,
               Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while
               Sonorous mettle blowing Martial sounds:
               At which the universal Host upsent
               A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond
               Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.
               All in a moment through the gloom were seen
               Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air
               With Orient Colours waving: with them rose
               A Forest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms
               Appeared, and serried Shields in thick array
               Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move
               In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood
               Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as raised
               To height of noblest temper Hero's old
               Arming to Battle, and in stead of rage
               Deliberate valour breathed, firm and unmoved
               With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,
               Nor wanting power to mitigate and swag
               With solemn touches, troubled thoughts, and chase
                  
               
               Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
               From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they
               Breathing united force with fixed thought
               Moved on in silence to soft Pipes that charmed
               Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil; and now
               Advanced in view, they stand, a horrid Front
               Of dreadful length and dazzling Arms, in guise
               Of Warriors old with ordered Spear and Shield,
               Awaiting what command their mighty Chief
               Had to impose: He through the armed Files
               Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse
               The whole Battalion views, their order due,
               Their visages and stature as of Gods,
               Their number last he sums.  And now his heart
               Distends with pride, and hardening in his strength
               Glories: For never since created man,
               Met such embodied force, as named with these
               Could merit more then that small infantry
               Warred on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood
               Of Phlegra with the Heroic Race were joined
               That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side
               Mixed with auxiliary Gods;  and what resounds
               In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons
               Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;
               And all who since, Baptised or Infidel
               Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,
               
                  Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond
               
               Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
               When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell
               By Fontarabbia.  Thus far these beyond
               Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed
               Their dread commander: he above the rest
               In shape and gesture proudly eminent
               Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost
               
               All her Original brightness, nor appeared
               Less then Arch Angel ruined, and the excess
               Of Glory obscured:  As when the Sun new risen
               Looks through the Horizontal misty Air
               Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon
               In dim Eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
               On half the Nations, and with fear of change
               Perplexes Monarch. Darkened so, yet shone
               Above them all the Arch Angel; but his face
               Deep scars of Thunder had entrenched, and care
               Sat on his faded cheek, but under Brows
               Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride
               Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
               Signs of remorse and passion to behold
               The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
               (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemned
               For ever now to have their lot in pain,
               Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced
               Of Heaven, and from Eternal Splendours flung
               For his revolt, yet faithful how they stood,
               Their Glory withered.  As when Heavens Fire
               Hath scathed the Forest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,
               With singed top their stately growth though bare
               Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepared
               To speak; whereat their doubled Ranks they bend
               From wing to wing, and half enclose him round
               With all his Peers: attention held them mute.
               Thrice he assayed, and thrice in spite of scorn,
               Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
               Words interwove with sighs found out their way.
               
                  

               
            
            
               He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew
               Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
               Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
               Far round illumined hell: highly they raged
               Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms
               Clashed on their sounding Shields the din of war,
               Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heaven.
            
            
               There stood a Hill not far whose grisly top
               Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire
               Shone with a glossy scurff, undoubted sign
               That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,
               The work of Sulphur.  Thither winged with speed
               A numerous Brigad hastened.  As when Bands
               Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax armed
               Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,
               Or cast a Rampart.  Mammon led them on,
               
                  Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell
               From heaven, for even in heaven his looks and thoughts
               Were always downward bent, admiring more
               The riches of Heavens pavement, trodden Gold,
               Then aught divine or holy else enjoyed
               In vision beatific: by him first
               Men also, and by his suggestion taught,
               Ransacked the Center, and with impious hands
               Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
               For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew
               Opened into the Hill a spacious wound
               And dug out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire
               That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best
               Deserve the precious bane.  And here let those
               Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell
                  
               
               Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings
               Learn how their greatest Monuments of Fame,
               And Strength and Art are easily out-done
               By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
               What in an age they with incessant toil
               And hands innumerable scarce perform.
               Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepared,
               That underneath had veins of liquid fire
               Sluiced from the Lake, a second multitude
               With wondrous Art found out the massy Ore,
               Severing each kind, and scummed the Bullion dross:
               A third as soon had formed within the ground
               A various mould, and from the boiling cells
               By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook,
               As in an Organ from one blast of wind
               To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.Fletcher
               
               Anon out of the earth a Fabric huge
               Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound
               Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,
               Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round
               Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
               With Golden Architrave; nor did there want
               Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures graven,
               The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not Babilon,
               Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
               Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine
               
                  Belus or Serapis their Gods, or seat
               Their Kings, when ??gypt with Assyria strove
               In wealth and luxury. The ascending pile
               Stood fixed her stately height, and strait the doors
               Opening their brazen folds discover wide
               Within, her ample spaces, o'er the smooth
               And level pavement: from the arched roof
               Pendant by subtle Magic many a row
               
               Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed
               With Naphtha and Asphaltus yielded 
light
               As from a sky. The hasty multitude
               Admiring entered, and the work some praise
               And some the Architect: his hand was known
               In Heaven by many a Towered structure high,
               Where Sceptred Angels held their residence,
               And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King                  
               Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
               Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.
               Nor was his name unheard or unadored
               In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
               Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell
               From Heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
               
               Sheer o'er the Crystal Battlements; from Morn
               To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
               A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
               Dropped from the Zenith like a falling Star,
               On Lemnos the ??g??an Isle: thus they
relate,
               Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
               Fell long before; nor aught availed him now
               To have built in Heaven high Towers; nor did he escape
               By all his Engines, but was headlong sent
               With his industrious crew to build in hell.
               Mean while the winged Heralds by command
               Of soverign power, with awful Ceremony
               And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim
               A solemn Council forthwith to be held
               At Pand??monium, the high Capital
               Of Satan and his Peers: their summons called
               From every Band and squared Regiment
               By place or choice the worthiest; they anon
               With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
               Attended: all access was thronged, the Gates
               
               And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall
               (Though like a covered field, where Champions bold
               Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldans chair
               Defied the best of Panim chivalry
               To mortal combat or career with Lance)
               Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,
               Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings.  As Bees
               In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
               Pour forth their populous youth about the Hive
               In clusters;  they among fresh dews and flowers
               Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,
               The suburb of their Straw-built Citadel,
               New rubbed with Baum, expatiate and confer
               Their State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd
               Swarmed and were straightened; till the Signal given,
               Behold a wonder! they but now who seemed
               In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons
               Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room
               Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race         
               Beyond the Indian Mount, or Fairy Elves,
               Whose midnight Revels, by a Forest side
               Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,
               Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon
               Sits Arbitress, and nearer to the Earth
               Wheels her pale course, they on their mirth and dance
               Intent, with jocund Music charm his ear;
               At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
               Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
               Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,
               Though without number still amidst the Hall
               Of that infernal Court. But far within
               And in their own dimensions like themselves
               The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
               
               In close recess and secret conclave sat
               A thousand demigods on golden seat's,
               Frequent and full.  After short silence then
               And summons read, the great consult began.
               The End of the First Book.
            
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. Book II.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            The Consultation begun, Satan debates whether anothere
 Battle be to be hazarded for the recovery of Heyven: some  advise
it, others dissuade:  A third proposal is preferred,  mentioned
before by Satan to search the truth of that Prophecy  or
Tradition in Heaven concerning another world, and another kind  of creature
equal or not much inferior to themselves, about  this time to be
created:  Their doubt who shall be sent on this  difficult search: Satan
their chief undertakes alone the  voyage, is honoured and applauded.
 The Council thus ended,  the rest betake them several ways and to
several employments, as  their inclinations lead them, to entertain the
time till 
Satan return.  He passes on his Journey to Hell Gates, 
finds them shut, and who sat there to guard them, by whom at  length
they are opened, and discover to him the great Gulf between  Hell and
Heaven;  with what difficulty he passes through,  directed by Chaos,
the Power of that place, to the sight of  this new World which he
sought.
            
            

            
               HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far
               Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
               Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
               Showers on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold,
               Satan exalted sat, by merit raised
               To that bad eminence; and from despair
               Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
               Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
               Vain War with Heaven, and by success untaught
               His proud imaginations thus displayed.

               
            
            
               He ceased, and next him Moloc, Sceptred King
               Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
               That fought in Heaven; now fiercer by despair:
               His trust was with the Eternal to be deemed
               Equal in strength, and rather then be less
               Cared not to be at all; with that care lost
               Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse
               He reckoned not, and these words thereafter spake.

               
            
            
               He ended frowning, and his look denounced
               Desperate revenge, and Battle dangerous
               To less then Gods.  On the other side up rose
               
                  Belial, in act more graceful and humane;
               A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed
               For dignity composed and high exploit:
               But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue
               Dropped Manna, and could make the worse appear
               The better reason, to perplex and dash
               Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;
               To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds
               Timorous and slothful: yet he pleased the ear,
               And with persuasive accent thus began.

               
            
            
               Thus Belial with words clothed in reasons  garb
               Counselled ignoble ease, and peaceful sloth,
               Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake.

               
            
            
               He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled
               The Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain
               The sound of blustering winds, which all night long
               Had roused the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
               Sea-faring men overwatched, whose Bark by chance
               Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay
               After the Tempest:  Such applause was heard
               As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleased,
               Advising peace: for such another Field
               They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear
               Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael
               
               Wrought still within them; and no less desire
               To found this nether Empire, which might rise
               By policy, and long process of time,
               In emulation opposite to Heaven.
               Which when Beelzebub perceived, then whom,
               
                  Satan except, none higher sat, with grave
               Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed
               A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven
               Deliberation sat and public care;
               And Princely counsel in his face yet shone, 
                  
               
               Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood
               With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
               The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look
               Drew audience and attention still as Night
               Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.
 Thus Beelzebub
               
               Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devised
               By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,
               But from the Author of all ill could Spring
               So deep a malice, to confound the race
               Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
               To mingle and involve, done all to spite
               The great Creator? But their spite still serves
               His glory to augment.  The bold design
               Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy
               Sparkled in all their eyes; with full assent
               They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.

               
            
            
               This said, he sat; and expectation held
               His look suspense, awaiting who appeared
               To second, or oppose, or undertake
               The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,
               Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each
               In others countenance read his own dismay
               Astonished: none among the choice and prime
               Of those Heaven-warring Champions could be found
               So hardy as to proffer or accept
               Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last
               
                  Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised
               Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride
               Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake.
 Thus
saying rose
               The Monarch, and prevented all reply,
               Prudent, least from his resolution raised
               Others among the chief might offer now
               (Certain to be refused) what erst they feared;
               And so refused might in opinion stand
               His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute
               Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they
               Dreaded not more the adventure then his voice
               
               Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;
               Their rising all at once was as the sound
               Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend
               With awful reverence prone; and as a God
               Extol him equal to the highest in Heaven:
               Nor failed they to express how much they praised,
               That for the general safety he despised
               His own: for neither do the Spirits damned
               Loose all her virtue; least bad men should boast
               Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
               Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.
               Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
               Ended rejoicing in their matchless Chief:
               As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
               Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, overspread
               Heavens cheerful face, the lowering Element
               Scowls ore the darkened landscape Snow, or shower;
               If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet
               Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,
               The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds
               Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
               O shame to men! Devil with Devil damned
               Firm concord holds, men only disagree
               Of Creatures rational, though under hope
               Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,
               Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife
               Among themselves, and levy cruel wars,
               Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:
               As if (which might induce us to accord)
               Man had not hellish foes enough besides,
               That day and night for his destruction wait.
            
            
               The Stygian Counsel thus dissolved; and forth
               In order came the grand infernal Peers,
               Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed 
               
               Alone the Antagonist of Heaven, nor less
               Than Hells dread Emperor with pomp Supreme,
               And God-like imitated State; him round
               A Globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
               With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.
               Then of their Session ended they bid cry
               With Trumpets regal sound the great result:
               Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
               Put to their mouths the sounding Alchemy
               By Heralds voice explained: the hollow Abyss
               Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell
               With deafening shout, returned them loud acclaim.
               Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
               By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers
               Disband, and wandering, each his several way
               Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
               Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find
               Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
               The irksome hours, till this great Chief return.
               Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime
               Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend,
               As at theOlympian Games or Pythian fields;
               Part curb their fiery Steeds, or shun the Goal
               With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.
               As when to warn proud Cities war appears
               Waged in the troubled Sky, and Armies rush
               To Battle in the Clouds, before each Van
               Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch their Spears
               Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms
               From either end of Heaven the welkin burns.
               Others with vast Typh??an rage more fell
               Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air
               In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.
               As when Alcides from Oechalia Crowned 
               
               With conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore
               Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,
               And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
               Into theEuboic Sea.  Others more mild,
               Retreated in a silent valley, sing
               With notes Angelical to many a Harp
               Their own Heroic deeds and hapless fall
               By doom of Battle; and complain that Fate
               Free Virtue should enthral to Force or Chance.
               Their Song was partial, but the harmony
               (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
               Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
               The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet
               (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)
               Others apart sat on a Hill retired,
               In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
               Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,
               Fixed Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
               And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
               Of good and evil much they argued then,
               Of happiness and final misery,
               Passion and Apathy, and glory and shame,
               Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophy:
               Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
               Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
               Fallacious hope, or arm the obdured breast
               With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
               Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,
               On bold adventure to discover wide
               That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps
               Might yield them easier habitation, bend
               Four ways their flying March, along the Banks
               Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge
               Into the burning Lake their baleful streams; 
               
               Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate,
               Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
               
                  Cocytus, named of lamentation loud
               Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton
               
               Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
               Far off from these a slow and silent stream,
               
                  Lethe the River of Oblivion roules
               Her watery Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,
               Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
               Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
               Beyond this flood a frozen Continent
               Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms
               Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land
               Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
               Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
               A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog
               Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,
               Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air
               Burns frore, and cold performs the effect of Fire.
               Thither by harpy-footed Furies hailed,
               At certain revolutions all the damned
               Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change
               Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,
               From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice
               Their soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine
               Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,
               Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
               They ferry over this Lethean Sound
               Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,
               And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
               The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose
               In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
               All in one moment, and so near the brink;
               But Fate  some copies have fate           withstands, and to oppose the attempt 
               
               
                  Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
               The Ford, and of it self the water flies
               All taste of living wight, as once it fled
               The lip of Tantalus.  Thus roving on
               In confused march forlorn, the adventrous Bands
               With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast
               Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found
               No rest: through many a dark and dreary Veil
               They passed, and many a Region dolorous,
               O'er many a Frozen, many a fiery Alpe,
               Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,
               A Universe of death, which God by curse
               Created evil, for evil only good,
               Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,
               Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
               Abominable, unutterable, and worse
               Than Fables yet have feigned, or fear conceived,
               
                  Gorgons and Hydra's, and 
Chimera's dire.
            
            
               Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,
               
                  Satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design,
               Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell
               Explores his solitary flight; some times
               He scours the right hand coast, some times the left,
               Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars
               Up to the fiery Concave touring high.
               As when far off at Sea a Fleet descried
               Hangs in the Clouds, by ??quinoctial Winds
               Close sailing from Bengala, or the Isles
               Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring
               Their spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood
               Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
               Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seemed
               Far off the flying Fiend: at last appear
               Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, 
               
               And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass,
               Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,
               Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,
               Yet unconsumed.  Before the Gates there sat
               On either side a formidable shape;
               The one seemed Woman to the waste, and fair,
               But ended foul in many a scaly fouled
               Voluminous and vast, a Serpent armed
               With mortal sting: about her middle round
               A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing barked
               With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung
               A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
               If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,
               And kennel there, yet there still barked and howled,
               Within unseen.  Far less abhorred than these
               Vexed Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts
               
                  Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:
               Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when called
               In secret, riding through the Air she comes
               Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance
               With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon
               Eclipses at their charms.  The other shape,
               If shape it might be called that shape had none
               Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb,
               Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,
               For each seemed either; black it stood as Night,
               Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
               And shook a dreadful Dart; what seemed his head
               The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.
               
                  Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
               The Monster moving onward came as fast
               With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.
               The undaunted Fiend what this might be admired, Admired, not feared;
God and his Son except, 
               
               Created thing nought valued he nor shunned;
               And with disdainful look thus first began.

               
            
            
               To whom the Goblin full of wrath replied,

               
            
            
               So spake the grisly terror, and in shape,
               So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold
               More dreadful and deform: on the other side
               Incensed  some copies have Licenced with indignation Satan stood
               Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burned,
               That fires the length of Ophiucus huge
               In the Arctic Sky, and from his horrid hair
               Shakes Pestilence and War. Each at the Head
               Leveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands 
                  
               
               No second stroke intend, and such a frown
               Each cast at the other, as when two black Clouds
               With Heavens Artillery fraught, come rattling on
               Over the Caspian, then stand front to front
               Hovering a space, till Winds the signal blow
               To join their dark Encounter in mid air:
               So frowned the mighty Combatants, that Hell
               Grew darker at their frown, so matched they stood;
               For never but once more was either like
               To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
               Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,
               Had not the Snaky Sorceress that sat
               Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,
               Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.

she  cried,

               
            
            
               She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
               Forbore, then these to her Satan returned:

               
            
            
               They whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate replied;

               
            
            
               She finished, and the subtle Fiend his lore
               Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth.

               
               He ceased, for both seemed highly pleased, and Death
               Grinnd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear 
                  
               
               His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw
               Destined to that good hour: no less rejoiced
               His mother bad, and thus bespoke her Sire.

               
            
            
               Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,
               Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
               And towards the Gate rolling her bestial train,
               Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,
               Which but her self not all the Stygian powers
               Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns
               Thunderstorm wards, and every Bolt and Bar
               Of massy Iron or solid Rock with ease
               Unfastens: on a sudden open fly
               With impetuous recoil and jarring sound 
               
               The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
               Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
               Of Erebus.  She opened, but to shut
               Excelled her power; the Gates wide open stood,
               That with extended wings a Bannered Host
               Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through
               With Horse and Chariots ranked in loose array;
               So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth
               Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.
               Before their eyes in sudden view appear
               The secrets of the hoary deep, a dark
               Illimitable Ocean without bound,
               Without dimension, where length, breadth, &amp; height,
               And time and place are lost; where eldest Night
               And Chaos.  Ancestors of Nature, hold
               Eternal Anarchy, amidst the noise
               Of endless Wars, and by confusion stand.
               For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce
               Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battle bring
               Their embryon Atoms; they around the flag
               Of each his Faction, in their several Clanns,
               Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,
               Swarm populous, unnumbered as the Sands
               Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,
               Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise
               Their lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,
               He rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,
               And by decision more embroils the fray
               By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter
               
                  Chance governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,
               The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
               Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
               But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
               Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, 
                  
               
               Unless the almighty Maker them ordain
               His dark materials to create more Worlds,
               Into this wild Abyss the wary fiend
               Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,
               Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
               He had to cross.  Nor was his ear less pealed
               With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
               Great things with small) then when Bellona storms,
               With all her battering Engines bent to raise
               Some Capital City; or less then if this frame
               Of Heaven were falling, and these Elements
               In mutiny had from her Axle torn
               The steadfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes
               He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoke
               Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League
               As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides
               Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets
               A vast vacuity: all unawares
               Fluttering his pennons vain plumb down he drops
               Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour
               Down had been falling, had not by ill chance
               The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
               Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him
               As many miles aloft: that fury stayed,
               Quenched in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,
               Nor good dry Land: nigh foundered on he fares,
               Treading the crude consistency, half on foot,
               Half flying; behoves him now both Oar and Sail.
               As when a Griffin through the Wilderness
               With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,
               Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth
               Had from his wakeful custody purloined
               The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend
               Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
               
               With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way,
               And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies:
               At length a universal hubbub wilde
               Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
               Born through the hollow dark assaults his ear
               With loudest vehemence: thither he plies,
               Undaunted to meet there what ever power
               Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
               Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
               Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
               Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne
               Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread
               Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthroned
               Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
               The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood
               
                  Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name
               Of Demogorgon; Rumour next and Chance,
               And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled,
               And Discord with a thousand various mouths.
            
            
               They whom Satan turning boldly, thus.

               
            
            
               Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old
               With faltering speech and visage incompos'd
               Answered. 

               
            
            
               He ceased; and Satan staid not to reply,
               But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,
               With fresh alacrity and force renewed
               Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire
               Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock
               Of fighting Elements, on all sides round
               Environed wins his way; harder beset 
               
               And more endangered, then when Argo passed
               Through Bosporus betwixt the jostling Rocks:
               Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunned
               
                  Charybdis, and by the other whirlpool steered.
               So he with difficulty and labour hard
               Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;
               But he once past, soon after when man fell,
               Strange alteration! Sin and Death  amain
               Following his track, such was the will of Heaven,
               Paved after him a broad and beaten way
               Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf
               Tamely endured a Bridge of wondrous length
               From Hell continued reaching th'utmost Orb
               Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
               With easy intercourse pass to and fro
               To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
               God and good Angels guard by special grace.
               But now at last the sacred influence
               Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven
               Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
               A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins
               Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire
               As from her outmost works a brok'd foe
               With tumult less and with less hostile din,
               That Satan with less toil, and now with ease
               Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
               And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds
               Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;
               Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,
               Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold
               Far off the Empyreal Heaven, extended wide
               In circuit, undetermined square or round,
               With Opal Towers and Battlements adorned
               Of living Sapphire, once his native Seat; 
               
               And fast by hanging in a golden Chain
               This pendant world, in bigness as a Star
               Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.
               Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,
               Accursed, and in a cursed hour he hies.
               The End of the Second Book.
            
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. Book III.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            God sitting on his Throne sees Satan flying towards this
world,  then newly created; shows him to the Son who sat at his right 
hand; foretells the success of Satan in perverting mankind; 
clears his own Justice and Wisdom from all imputation, having  created
Man free and able enough to have withstood his  Templa; yet
declares his purpose of grace towards him, in  regard he fell not of his
own malice; as did Satan, but by him  seduced.  The Son of God
renders praises to his Father for the  manifestation of his gracious purpose
towards Man; but God  again declares, that Grace cannot be extended
towards Man without  the satisfaction of divine Justice; Man hath
offended the majesty  of God by aspiring to God-head, and therefore
with all his  Progeny devoted to death must dye, unless some one can be
found  sufficient to answer for his offence, and undergo his Punishment.
  The Son of God freely offers himself a Ransom for Man: the 
 Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation,  pronounces
his exaltation above all Names in Heaven and  Earth; commands all the
Angels to adore him; they obey, and  hymning to their Harps in full
Quire, celebrate the Father and the  Son.  Mean while  Satan
alights upon the bare Convex of  this Worlds outermost Orb; where
wandering he first finds a  place since called The Lymbo of Vanity; what
persons and things  fly up thither; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven,
described  ascending by stairs, and the waters above the Firmament
 that flow about it: His passage thence to the Orb of the Sun; he  finds
there Uriel the Regient of that Orb, but first changes 
himself into the shape of a meaner Angel; and pretending a  zealous
desire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had  placed here,
enquires of him the place of his habitation, and is  directed; alights
first on Mount 
               Niphates.
            

            
               HAil holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born,
               Or of the Eternal Coeternal beam
               May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,
               And never but in unapproached light
               Dwelt from Eternity, dwelt then in thee,
               Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
               Or hear thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
               Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
               Before the Heavens thou were, and at the voice
               Of God, as with a Mantle did invest
               The rising world of waters dark and deep,
               Won from the void and formless infinite.
               Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
               Escaped the Stygian Pool, though long detained 
               
               In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
               Through utter and through middle darkness borne
               With other notes then to the Orphean Lyre
               I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,
               Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
               The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
               Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
               And feel thy soverign vital Lamp; but thou
               Revisits not these eyes, that roll in vain
               To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
               So thick a drop serene hath quenched their Orbs,
               Or dim suffusion veiled.  Yet not the more
               Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
               Clear Spring, or shady Grove, or Sunny Hill,
               Smite with the love of sacred Song; but chief
               Thee Zion and the flowery Brooks beneath
               That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,
               Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
               Those other two equalled with me in Fate,
               So were I equalled with them in renown,
               Blind Thamyris and blind M??onides,
               And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old.
               Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
               Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
               Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
               Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year
               Seasons return, but not to me returns
               Day, or the sweet approach of Even or Morn,
               Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
               Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
               But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
               Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
               Cut off, and for the Book of knowledge fair
               Presented with a Universal blanc 
               
               Of Natures works to me expunged and rased,
               And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
               So much the rather thou Celestial light
               Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
               Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
               Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
               Of things invisible to mortal sight.
            
            
               Now had the Almighty Father from above,
               From the pure Empyrean where he sits
               High Throned above all height, bent down his eye,
               His own works and their works at once to view:
               About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
               Stood thick as Stars, and from his sight received
               Beatitude past utterance; on his right
               The radiant image of his Glory sat,
               His only Son; On Earth he first beheld
               Our two first Parents, yet the only two
               Of mankind, in the happy Garden placed,
               Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
               Uninterrupted joy, unrivaled love
               In blissful solitude; he then surveyed
               Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there
               Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
               In the dun Air sublime, and ready now
               To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet
               On the bare outside of this World, that seemed
               Firm land bosomed without Firmament,
               Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.
               Him God beholding from his prospect high,
               Wherein past, present, future he beholds,
               Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.

               
            
            
               Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance filled
               All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect
               Sense of new joy ineffable diffused:
               Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
               Most glorious, in him all his Father shone
               Substantially expressed, and in his face
               Divine compassion visibly appeared,
               Love without end, and without measure Grace,
               Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.

               
            
            
               To whom the great Creator thus replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               He asked, but all the Heavenly Quire stood mute,
               And silence was in Heaven: on mans behalf 
                  
               
               Patron or Intercessor none appeared,
               Much less that dared upon his own head draw
               The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
               And now without redemption all mankind
               Must have bin lost, adjudged to Death and Hell
               By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
               In whom the fullness dwells of love divine,
               His dearest mediation thus renewed.

               
            
            
               His words here ended, but his meek aspect
               Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love
               To mortal men, above which only shone
               Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
               Glad to be offered, he attends the will
               Of his great Father.  Admiration seized
               All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend
               Wondering; but soon the Almighty thus replied:

               
            
            
               No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all
               The multitude of Angels with a shout
               Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
               As from blessed voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung
               With Jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled
               The eternal Regions: lowly reverent
               Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground
               With solemn adoration down they cast
               Their Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,
               Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once
               In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life
               Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence 
               
               To Heaven removed where first it grew, there grows,
               And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,
               And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heaven
               Rolls o'er Elision Flours her Amber stream;
               With these that never fade the Spirits elect
               Bind their resplendent locks enwreathed with beams,
               Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright
               Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shone
               Inpurpled with Celestial Roses smiled.
               Then Crowned again their golden Harps they took,
               Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
               Like Quivers hung, and with Pr??amble sweet
               Of charming symphony they introduce
               Their sacred Song, and waken raptures high;
               No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
               Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
            
            
               Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,
               Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
               Eternal King; thee Author of all being,
               Fountain of Light, thy self invisible
               Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit
               Throned inaccessible, but when thou shades
               The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
               Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,
               Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
               Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
               Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
               Thee next they sang of all Creation first,
               Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
               In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
               Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
               Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee
               Impressed the effulgence of his Glory abides,
               Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.
               
               He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
               By thee created, and by thee threw down
               The aspiring Dominations: thou that day
               Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder did not spare,
               Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook
               Heavens everlasting Frame, while o'er the necks
               Thou drove of warring Angels disarrayed.
               Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
               Thee only extolled, Son of thy Fathers might,
               To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
               Not so on Man; him through their malice fallen,
               Father of Mercy and Grace, thou did not doom
               So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
               No sooner did thy dear and only Son
               Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
               So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
               He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
               Of Mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
               Regardless of the Bliss wherein he sat
               Second to thee, offered himself to die
               For mans offence.  O unexampled love,
               Love no where to be found less then Divine!
               Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name
               Shall be the copious matter of my Song
               Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise
               Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin.

               
            
            
               Thus they in Heaven, above the starry Sphere,
               Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
               Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe
               Of this round World, whose first convex divides
               The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosed
               From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,
               
                  Satan alighted walks: a Globe far off
               It seemed, now seems a boundless Continent 
               
               Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
               Starless exposed, and ever-threatning storms
               Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
               Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
               Though distant far some small reflection gains
               Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
               Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
               As when a Vulture on Imaus bred,
               Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
               Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey
               To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids
               On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs
               Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
               But in his way lights on the barren Plains
               Of Sericana, where Chinese drive
               With Sails and Wind their canie Waggons light:
               So on this windy Sea of Land, the Fiend
               Walked up and down alone bent on his prey,
               Alone, for other Creature in this place
               Living or lifeless to be found was none,
               None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
               Up hither like Aerial vapours flew
               Of all things transitory and vain, when Sin
               With vanity had filled the works of men:
               Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
               Built their fond hopes of Glory or lasting fame,
               Or happiness in this or the other life;
               All who have their reward on Earth, the fruits
               Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,
               Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
               Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
               All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,
               Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
               Dissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 
               
               Till final dissolution, wander here,
               Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamt;
               Those argent Fields more likely habitants,
               Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
               Betwixt the Angelical and Human kind:
               Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born
               First from the ancient World those Giants came
               With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
               The builders next of Babel on the Plain
               Of Sennaar, and still with vain design
               New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
               Others came single; he who to be deemed
               A God, leaped fondly into ??tna flames,
               
                  Empedocles, and he who to enjoy
               
                  Plato's Elysium, leaped into the Sea,
               
                  Cleombrotus, and many more too long,
               Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friars
               White, Black and Grey, with all their trumpery.
               Here Pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
               In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
               And they who to be sure of Paradise
               Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,
               Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
               They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixed,
               And that Crystalline Sphere whose balance weighs
               The Trepidation talked, and that first moved;
               And now Saint Peter at Heavens Wicket seems
               To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot
               Of Heavens ascent they lift their Feet, when lo
               A violent cross wind from either Coast
               Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry
               Into the devious Air; then might ye see
               Cowles, Hoods and Habits with their wearers tossed
               And fluttered into Rags, then Relics, Beads, 
               
               Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,
               The sport of Winds: all these appareled aloft
               Fly o'er the backside of the World far off
               Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
               The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
               Long after, now unpeopled, and untrod;
               All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he passed,
               And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
               Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
               His travelled steps; far distant he descries
               Ascending by degrees magnificent
               Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,
               At top whereof, but far more rich appeared
               The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate
               With Frontispiece of Diamond and Gold
               Embellished, thick with sparkling orient Gems
               The Portal shone, inimitable on Earth
               By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.
               The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
               Angels ascending and descending, bands
               Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
               To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
               Dreaming by night under the open Sky,
               And waking cried, This is the Gate of Heaven
               
               Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
               There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
               Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flowed
               Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearl, whereon
               Who after came from Earth, sailing arrived,
               Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the Lake
               Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.
               The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare
               The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate
               His sad exclusion from the doors of Bliss. 
               
               Direct against which opened from beneath,
               Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,
               A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,
               Wider by far then that of after-times
               Over Mount Zion, and, though that were large,
               Over the Promised Land to God so dear,
               By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,
               On high behests his Angels to and fro
               Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard
               From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
               To Beersaba, where the Holy Land
               
               Borders on ??gypped and the Arabian shore;
               So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set
               To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.
               
                  Satan from hence now on the lower stair
               That scaled by steps of Gold to Heaven Gate
               Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
               Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout
               Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
               All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn
               Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,
               Which to his eye discovers unaware
               The goodly prospect of some foreign land
               First-seen, or some renowned Metropolis
               With glistening Spires and Pinnacles adorned,
               Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.
               Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,
               The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized
               At sight of all this World beheld so fair.
               Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood
               So high above the circling Canopy
               Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point
               Of Libra to the fleecy Star that bears
               
                  Andromeda far off Atlantic Seas 
               
               Beyond the Horizon; then from Pole to Pole
               He views in breadth, and without longer pause
               Down right into the Worlds first Region throws
               His flight precipitant, and winds with ease
               Through the pure marble Air his oblique way
               Amongst innumerable Stars, that shone
               Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other Worlds,
               Or other Worlds they seemed, or happy Isles,
               Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,
               Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flowery Vales,
               Thrice happy Isles, but who dwelt happy there
               He stayed not to enquire: above them all
               The golden Sun in splendour likest Heaven
               Allured his eye: Thither his course he bends
               Through the calm Firmament; but up or down
               By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,
               Or Longitude, where the great Luminary
               Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,
               That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,
               Dispenses Light from far; they as they move
               Their Starry dance in numbers that compute
               Days, months, &amp;years, towards his all-cheering Lamp
               Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
               By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms
               The Universe, and to each inward part
               With gentle penetration, though unseen,
               Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep:
               So wondrously was set his Station bright.
               There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
               Astronomer in the Sun's legend Orb
               Through his glazed Optic Tube yet never saw.
               The place he found beyond expression bright,
               Compared with aught on Earth, Medal
               Not all parts like, but all alike informed 
               
               With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;
               If mettle, part seemed Gold, part Silver clear;
               If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,
               Ruby or Topaz, to the Twelve that shone
               In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides
               Imagined rather oft then elsewhere seen,
               That stone, or like to that which here below
               Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
               In vain, though by their powerful Art they bind
               Volatile Harms, and call up unbound
               In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea,
               Drained through a Limbec to his Native form.
               What wonder then if fields and regions here
               Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run
               Potable Gold, when with one virtuous touch
               The Arch-chimic Sun so far from us remote
               Produces with Terrestrial Humour mixed
               Here in the dark so many precious things
               Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
               Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
               Undazzled, far and wide his eye commands,
               For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
               But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon
               Culminate from the ??quator, as they now
               Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
               Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Air,
               No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray
               To objects distant far, whereby he soon
               Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
               The same whom John saw also in the Sun:
               His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
               Of beaming sunny Rays, a golden tiar
               Circled his Head, nor less his Locks behind
               Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings 
               
               Lay waving round; on some great charge employed
               He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
               Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
               To find who might direct his wandering flight
               To Paradise the happy seat of Man,
               His journeys end and our beginning woe.
               But first he casts to change his proper shape,
               Which else might work him danger or delay:
               And now a stripling Cherub he appears,
               Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
               Youth smiled Celestial, and to every Limb
               Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned;
               Under a Coronet his flowing hair
               In curls on either cheek plaid, wings he wore
               Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with Gold,
               His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
               Before his decent steps a Silver wand.
               He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,
               Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,
               Admonished by his ear, and strait was known
               The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven
               Who in Gods presence, nearest to his Throne
               Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes
               That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth
               Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
               O'er Sea and Land: him Satan thus accosts;

               
            
            
               So spake the false dissembler unperceived;
               For neither Man nor Angel can discern
               Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
               Invisible, except to God alone,
               By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:
               And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
               At wisdom's Gate, and to simplicity
               Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
               Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled
               
                  Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held
               The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;
               Who to the fraudulent Impostor foul
               In his uprightness answer thus returned.
               
                  

               
            
            
               Thus said, he turned, and Satan bowing low,
               As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,
               Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
               Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,
               Down from the Ecliptic, sped with hoped success,
               Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheel,
               Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.
               The End of the Third Book.
            
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. Book IV.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
               Satan now in prospect of Eden,  and nigh the
place where he  must now attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook
 alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with himself,  and
many passions, fear, envy, and despair;  but at length  confirms himself
in evil, journeys on to Paradise,  whose outward prospect
and situation is described, overleaps the  bounds, sits in the shape of
a Cormorant on the Tree of life, as  highest in the Garden to look
about him.  The Garden  decribbed; Satan's first sight of
Adam and Eve; his  wonder at their excellent form and
happy state, but with  resolution to work their fall; overhears their discourse,
 thence gathers that the Tree of knowledge was forbidden them to  eat
of, under penalty of death; and thereon intends to found his 
Temptation, by seducing them to transgress: then leaves them  a
while, to know further of their state by some other means.   Meanwhile
Uriel descending on a Sun-beam warns Gabriel, who 
had in charge the Gate of Paradise, 
               
 that some evil spirit had escaped the
Deep, and  past at Noon by his Sphere in the shape of a good Angel
down  to Paradise, discovered after by his furious 
gestures in the Mount. Gabriel promises to find him ere 
morning.  Night coming on, Adam and Eve, discourse
of going  to their rest: their Bower described; their Evening worship. 
Gabriel drawing forth his Bands of Night-watch to walk the 
round of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to 
Adams Bower, least the evil spirit should be there doing some
 harm to Adam or Eve sleeping; there they find him
at the ear  of Eve,tempting her in a dream, and bring him,
though  unwilling, to Gabriel;  by whom questioned, he
scornfully  answers, prepares resistance, but hindered by a Sign from
Heaven,  flies out of Paradise.
            

            
               O For that warning voice, which he who saw
               TheApocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
               Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
               Came furious down to be revenged on men,
               
                  
                     
 that now,
               While time was, our first-Parents had bin warned
               The coming of their secret foe, and escaped
               Happily so escaped his mortal snare; for now
               
                  Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,
               The Tempter ere the Accuser of man-kind,
               To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
               Of that first Battle, and his flight to Hell:
               Yet not rejoicing in his speed, though bold,
               Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
               Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth
               Now rolling, boils in his tumultuous breast,
               And like a devilish Engine back recoils
               Upon himself; horror and doubt distract 
               
               His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir
               The Hell within him, for within him Hell
               He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
               One step no more then from himself can fly
               By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair
               That slumberd, wakes the bitter memory
               Of what he was, what is, and what must be
               Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
               Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
               Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad,
               Sometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing Sun,
               Which now sat high in his Meridian Tower:
               Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.

               
            
            
               Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face
               Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy and despair,
               Which mart his borrowed visage, and betrayed
               Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.
               For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
               Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware,
               Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm, 
               
               Artificer of fraud; and was the first
               That practiced falsehood under saintly show,
               Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:
               Yet not enough had practiced to deceive
               
                  Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down
               The way he went, and on theAssyrian mount
               Saw him disfigured, more then could befall
               Spirit of happy sort: his gestures fierce
               He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,
               As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
               So on he fares, and to the border comes,
               Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,
               Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,
               As with a rural mound the champagne head
               Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides
               With thicket overgrown, gottesque and wilde,
               Access denied; and over head up grew
               Insuperable height of loftiest shade,
               Cedar, and Pine, and Fur, and branching Palm,
               A Sylvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend
               Shade above shade, a woody Theatre
               Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then their tops
               The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung:
               Which to our general Sire gave prospect large
               Into his nether Empire neighbouring round.
               And higher then that Wall a circling row
               Of goodliest Trees laden with fairest Fruit,
               Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue
               Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:
               On which the Sun more glad impressed his beams
               Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,
               When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed
               That Landscape: And of pure now purer air
               Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires 
               
               Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
               All sadness but despair: now gentle gales
               Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
               Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
               Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who sail
               Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past
               
                  Mozambic, off at Sea North-East winds blow
               
                  Sabean Odours from the spicy shore
               Of Arabia the blessed, with such delay
               Well pleased they slack their course, and many a League
               Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.
               So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend
               Who came their bane, though with them better pleased
               Then Asmodeus with the fishy fume,
               That drove him, though enamoured, from the Spouse
               Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent
               From Media post to ??gypped, there fast
bound.
            
            
               Now to The ascent of that steep savage Hill
               
                  Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;
               But further way found none, so thick entwined,
               As one continued brake, the undergrowth
               Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
               All path of Man or Beast that past that way:
               One Gate there only was, and that looked East
               On the other side: which when th'arch-fellon saw
               Due entrance he disdained, and in contempt,
               At one slight bound high over leaped all bound
               Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within
               Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolf,
               Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
               Watching where Shepherds pen their Flocks at eave
               In hurdled Cotes amid the field secure,
               Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the Fouled:.
               Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash 
               
               Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial doors,
               Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,
               In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles;
               So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fouled:
               So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climb.
               Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,
               The middle Tree and highest there that grew,
               Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life
               Thereby regained, but sat devising Death
               To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought
               Of that life-giving Plant, but only used
               For prospect, what well used had bin the pledge
               Of immortality.  So little knows
               Any, but God alone, to value right
               The good before him, but perverts best things
               To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
               Beneath him with new wonder now he views
               To all delight of human sense exposed
               In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,
               A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise
               
               Of God the Garden was, by him in the East
               Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her Line
               From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towers
               Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings,
               Or where the Sons of Eden long before
               Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soil
               His far more pleasant Garden God ordained;
               Out of the fertile ground he cause to grow
               All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
               And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,
               High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit
               Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life
               Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by,
               Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. 
                  
               
               Southward through Eden went a River large,
               Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill
               Passed underneath engulfed, for God had thrown
               That Mountain as his Garden mould high raised
               Upon the rapid current, which through veins
               Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,
               Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill
               Watered the Garden; thence united fell
               Down the steep glade, and met the nether Flood,
               Which from his darksome passage now appears,
               And now divided into four main Streams,
               Runs divers, wandering many a famous Realm
               And Country whereof here needs no account,
               But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
               How from that Sapphire Fount the crisped Brooks,
               Rolling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,
               With mazy error under pendant shades
               Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
               Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
               In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon
               Poured forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plain,
               Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
               The open field, and where the unpierced shade
               Imbround the noontide Bowers: Thus was this place,
               A happy rural seat of various view;
               Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balm,
               Others whose fruit burnished with Golden Rind
               Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true,
               If true, here only, and of delicious taste:
               Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks
               Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,
               Or palmy hellos, or the flowery lap
               Of some irriguous Valley spread her store,
               Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: 
               
               Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves
               Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine
               Lays forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps
               Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
               Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a Lake,
               That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crowned,
               Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams.
               The Birds their quire apply; aires, vernal aires,
               Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
               The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan
               
               Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
               Led on the Eternal Spring.  Not that fair field
               Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours
               Her self a fairer Flower by gloomy Dis
               
               Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain
               To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove
               Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired
               
                  Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise
               
               Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Isle
               Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham,
               Whom Gentiles 
                  Ammon call and Lybian
Jove,
               Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son
               Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea's eye;
               Nor where Abassin Kings their issue Guard,
               Mount Amara, though this by some supposed
               True Paradise under the Ethiop Line
               By Nilus head, enclosed with shining Rock,
               A whole days journey high, but wide remote
               From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend
               Saw undelighted all delight, all kind
               Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:
               Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,
               Godlike erect, with native Honour clad
               In naked Majesty seemed Lords of all,
               
               And worthy seemed, for in their looks Divine
               The image of their glorious Maker shone,
               Truth, wisdom, Sanctitude severe and pure,
               Severe but in true filial freedom placed;
               Whence true authority in men; though both
               Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;
               For contemplation he and valour formed,
               For softness she and sweet attractive Grace,
               He for God only, she for God in him:
               His fair large Front and Eye sublime declared
               Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks
               Round from his parted forelock manly hung
               Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
               She as a veil down to the slender waste
               Her unadorned golden tresses wore
               Disheveled, but in wanton ringlets waved
               As the Vine curls her tendrils, which implied
               Subjection, but required with gentle sway,
               And by her yielded, by him best received,
               Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
               And sweet reluctant amorous delay.
               Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed,
               Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame
               Of natures works, honour dishonourable,
               Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind
               With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,
               And banished from mans life his happiest life,
               Simplicity and spotless innocence.
               So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight
               Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:
               So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair
               That ever since in loves embraces met,
               
                  Adam the goodliest man of men since borne
               His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. 
               
               Under a tuft of shade that on a green
               Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side
               They sat them down, and after no more toil
               Of their sweet Gardening labour then sufficed
               To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease
               More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite
               More grateful, to their Supper Fruits they fell,
               Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughs
               Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
               On the soft downy Bank damasked with flours:
               The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind
               Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;
               Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
               Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as seems
               Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial League,
               Alone as they.  About them frisking played
               All Beasts of the Earth, since wilde, and of all chase
               In Wood or Wilderness, Forest or Den;
               Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw
               Dandled the Kid; Bears, Tigers, Ounces, Pards,
               Gambold before them, th'unwieldy Elephant
               To make them mirth used all his might, and wreathed
               His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly
               Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
               His breaded train, and of his fatal guile
               Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
               Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,
               Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun
               Declined was hasting now with prone career
               To the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending Scale
               Of Heaven the Stars that usher Evening rose:
               When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
               Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.

               
            
            
               So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,
               The Tyrants plea, excused his devilish deeds.
               Then from his lofty stand on that high Tree
               Down he alights among the sportful Herd
               Of those fourfooted kinds, himself now one,
               Now other, as their shape served best his end
               Nearer to view his prey, and unespi'd
               To mark what of their state he more might learn
               By word or action marked: about them round
               A Lion now he stalks with fiery glare,
               Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spied
               In some Purlieu two gentle Fawns at play,
               Strait couches close, then rising changes oft
               His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground
               Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
               Gripped in each paw: When Adam first of men
               To first of women Eve thus moving speech,
               Turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve replied.

               
            
            
               So spake our general Mother, and with eyes
               Of conjugal attraction unreproved,
               And meek surrender, half embracing leant 
               
               On our first Father, half her swelling Breast
               Naked met his under the flowing Gold
               Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
               Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms
               Smiled with superior Love, as Jupiter
               
               On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds
               That shed May Flowers; and pressed her Matron lip
               With kisses pure: aside the Devil turned
               For envy, yet with jealous leer malign
               Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plaint.

               
            
            
               So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,
               But with sly circumspection, and began
               Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale his roam.
               Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heaven
               With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun
               Slowly descended, and with right aspect
               Against the eastern Gate of Paradise
               
               Leveled his evening Rays: it was a Rock
               Of Alabaster, piled up to the Clouds,
               Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent
               Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;
               The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung
               Still as it rose, impossible to climb.
               Betwixt these rocky Pillars Gabriel sat
               Chief of the Angelic Guards, awaiting night;
               About him exercised Heroic Games
               The unarmed Youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand
               Celestial Armoury, Shields, Helmes, and Spears,
               Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.
               Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Even
               On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Star
               In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fired
               Impress the Air, and shows the Mariner
               From what point of his Compass to beware
               Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.

               
            
            
               To whom the winged Warrior thus returned:

               
            
            
               So promised he, and Uriel to his charge
               Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised
               Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fallen
               Beneath theAzores; whither the prime Orb,
               Incredible how swift, had thither rolled
               Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth
               By shorter flight to the East, had left him there
               Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold 
                  some copies have '101' 
                  
               
               The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:
               Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
               Had in her sober Livery all things clad;
               Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,
               They to their grassy Couch, these to their Nests
               Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;
               She all night long her amorous descant sung;
               Silence was pleased: now glowed the Firmament
               With living Sapphires: Hesperus that led
               The starry Host, rode brightest, till the Moon
               Rising in clouded Majesty, at length
               Apparent Queen unveiled her peerless light,
               And o'er the dark her Silver Mantle threw.
            
            
               When Adam thus to Eve:

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty  adorned.

               
            
            
               To whom our general Ancestor replied.

               
            
            
               Thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
               On to their blissful Bower; it was a place
               Chosen by the soverign Planter, when he framed
               All things to mans delightful use; the roof
               Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
               Laurel and Myrtle, and what higher grew
               Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
               
                  Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub
               Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,
               
                  Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin 
               
               Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought
               Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,
               Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay
               Broiderd the ground, more coloured then with stone
               Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here
               Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm dared enter none;
               Such was their awe of Man.  In shady Bower
               More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,
               
                  Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph,
               Nor Faunus haunted.  Here in close recess
               With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs
               Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial Bed,
               And heavenly Quires the Hymenae??an sung,
               What day the genial Angel to our Sire
               Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,
               More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods
               Endowed with all their gifts, and O too like
               In sad event, when to the unwiser Son
               Of Japhet brought by Harms, she ensnared
               Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged
               On him who had stole Joves authentic fire.
            
            
               Thus at their shady Lodge arrived, both stood
               Both turned, and under open Sky adored
               The God that made both Sky, Air, Earth and Heaven
               Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe
               And starry Pole: 

               
            
            
               This said unanimous, and other Rites
               Observing none, but adoration pure
               Which God likes best, into their inmost bower
               Handed they went; and eased the putting off
               These troublesome disguises which wee wear,
               Strait side by side were laid, nor turned I wean
               
                  Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites
               Mysterious of connubial Love refused:
               Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk
               Of purity and place and innocence,
               Defaming as impure what God declares
               Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
               Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain
               But our destroyer, foe to God and Man?
               Hail wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source
               Of human offspring, sole propriety,
               In Paradise of all things common else.
               By thee adulterous lust was driven from men
               Among the bestial herds to range, by thee
               Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure,
               Relations dear, and all the Charities
               Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.
               Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
               Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
               Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,
               Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,
               Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs used.
               Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights
               His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
               Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
               Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unhindered, 
               
               Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours
               Mixed Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,
               Or Serenate, which the starved Lover sings
               To his proud fair, best quited with disdain.
               These lulled by Nightingales embracing slept,
               And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
               Showered Roses, which the Morn repaired.  Sleep on
               Blessed pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek
               No happier state, and know to know no more.
            
            
               Now had night measured with her shadow Cone
               Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,
               And from their Ivory Port the Cherubim
               Forth issuing at th'accustomd hour stood armed
               To their night watches in warlike Parade,
               When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
 As
flame they part
               Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.
               From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called
               That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

               
            
            
               So saying, on he led his radiant Files,
               Dazzling the Moon; these to the Bower direct
               In search of whom they sought: him there they found
               Squat like a Toad, close at the ear of Eve; 
               
               Assaying by his Devilish art to reach
               The Organs of her Fancy, and with them forge
               Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,
               Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
               The animal Spirits that from pure blood arise
               Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise
               At least distempered, discontented thoughts,
               Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires
               Blown up with high conceits engendering pride.
               Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear
               Touched lightly; for no falsehood can endure
               Touch of Celestial temper, but returns
               Of force to its own likeness: up he starts
               Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark
               Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid
               Fit for the Tun some Magazine to store
               Against a rumoured War, the Smutty grain
               With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the Air:
               So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
               Back stepped those two fair Angels half amazed
               So sudden to behold the grisly King;
               Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.
then said Satan, filled  with
scorn,

               
               To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. 
                  

               
            
            
               So spake the Cherub, and his grave rebuke
               Severe in youthful beauty, added grace
               Invincible: abashed the Devil stood,
               And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
               Virtue in her shape how lovely, saw, and pined
               His loss; but chiefly to find here observed
               His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed
               Undaunted. 

 said he,

 said Zephon  bold,
               Will save us trial what the least can doe
               Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.

               
            
            
               The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;
               But like a proud Steed reined, went haughty on,
               Champing his iron curb: to strive or fly
               He held it vain; awe from above had quelled
               His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh
               The western Point, where those half-rounding guards
               Just met, and closing stood in squadron joint
               Awaiting next command.  To whom their Chief
               
                  Gabriel from the Front thus called aloud.

               
            
            
               He scarce had ended, when those two approached
               And brief related whom they brought, where found,
               How busied, in what form and posture couched.
            
            
               To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow.

               
            
            
               Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel moved,
               
               Disdainfully half smiling thus replied.

               
            
            
               To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern.

               
            
            
               To whom the warrior Angel, soon replied.

               
            
            
               So threatened he, but Satan to no threats
               Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. 
                  

               
            
            
               While thus he spake, the Angelic Squadron bright
               Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns
               Their Phalanx, and began to hemm him round
               With ported Spears, as thick as when a field
               Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
               Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind
               Sways them; the careful Ploughmen doubting stands
               Least on the threshing floor his hopeful sheaves
               Prove chaff. On the other side Satan alarmed
               Collecting all his might dilated stood,
               Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved:
               His stature reached the Sky, and on his Crest
               Sat horror Plumed; nor wanted in his grasp
               What seemed both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds
               Might have ensued, nor only Paradise
               
               In this commotion, but the Starry Cope
               Of Heaven perhaps, or all the Elements
               At least had gon to rack, disturbed and torn
               With violence of this conflict, had not soon
               the Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
               Hung forth in Heaven his golden Scales, yet seen
               Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,
               Wherein all things created first he weight,
               The pendulous round Earth with balanced Air
               In counterpoised, now ponders all events,
               Battles and Realms: in these he put two weights
               The sequel each of parting and of fight; 
                  
               
               The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam;
               Which Gabriel spying, thus bespoke the Fiend.
 The Fiend looked up
and knew
               His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled
               Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

            Paradise Lost. Book V.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            Morning approached, Eve relates to Adam her
troublesome  dream; he likes it not, yet comforts her: They come
forth to their  day labours; Their Morning Hymn at the Door of their Bower.
 God to  render Man inexcusable sends Raphael to admonish
him of  his obeaudience, of his free estate, of his enemy near at 
hand; who he is, and why his enemy, and whatever else may avail 
Adam to know. Raphael comes down to   Paradise,
his appearance described, his coming  discerned by Adam afar
off sitting at the door of his Bower; he  goes out to meet him, brings
him to his lodge, entertains  him with the choicest fruits of
Paradise got  together by Eve;their
discourse at Table: Raphael  performs his message, minds Adam
of his state and of his enemy;  relates at Adams request who
that enemy is, and how he came to  be so, beginning from his first
revolt in Heaven, and the  occasion thereof; how he drew his Legions
after him to the parts  of the 
               
 North, and there incited  them to rebel
with him, perswading all but only Abdiel a  Seraph, who
in Arguemeant dissuades and opposes him, then  forsakes him.
            

            
               NOw Morn her rosie steps in the Eastern Clime
               Advancing, sowed the earth with Orient Pearl,
               When Adam waked, so customed, for his sleep
               Was Aerie light from pure digestion bred,
               And temperate vapors bland, which the only sound
               Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
               Lightly dispersed, and the shrill Matin Song
               Of Birds on every bough; so much the more
               His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
               
               With Tresses discomposed, and glowing Cheek,
               As through unquiet rest: he on his side
               Leaning half-raised, with looks of cordial Love
               Hung over her enamoured, and beheld
               Beauty, which whether waking or asleep,
               Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice
               Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
               Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.

               
            
            
               Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye 
               On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
               
                  
 Thus Eve
her  Night
               Related, and thus Adam answered sad.

               
            
            
               So cheered he his fair Spouse, and she was cheered,
               But silently a gentle tear let fall
               From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;
               Two other precious drops that ready stood, 
               
               Each in their Crystal sluice, he ere they fell
               Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
               And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
            
            
               So all was cleared, and to the Field they haste.
               But first from under shady arborous roof,
               Soon as they forth were come to open sight
               Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen
               With wheels yet hovering o'er the Ocean brim,
               Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,
               Discovering in wide Landscape all the East
               Of Paradise and Edens happy Plains,
               Lowly they bowed adoring, and began
               Their Orisons, each Morning duly paid
               In various style, for neither various style
               Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
               Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced or sung
               Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence
               Flowed from their lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,
               More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp
               To add more sweetness, and they thus began.

               
            
            
               So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts
               Firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm.
               On to their mornings rural work they haste
               Among sweet dews and flours; where any row
               Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reached too far
               Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check
               Fruitless embraces: or they led the Vine
               To wed her Elm; she spoused about him twines
               Her marriageable arms, and with her brings
               Her dour the adopted Clusters, to adorn
               His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld
               With pity Heavens high King, and to him called
               
                  Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned
               To travel with Tobias, and secured
               His marriage with the seven times wedded Maid.

               
            
            
               So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled
               All Justice: nor delayed the winged Saint
               After his charge received, but from among
               Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood
               Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light
               Flew through the midst of Heaven; the Angelic Quires
               On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
               Through all the Empyreal road; till at the Gate
               Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide
               On golden Hinges turning, as by work
               Divine the soverign Architect had framed.
               From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
               Star interposed, however small he sees,
               Not unconfirmed to the other shining Globes,
               Earth and the Garden of God, with Cedars crowned
               Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass
               Of Galileo, less assured, observes
               Imagined Lands and Regions in the Moon:
               Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades
               
               
                  Delos or Samos first appearing kens
               A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight
               He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Sky
               Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing 
               
               Now on the polar winds, then with quick Fann
               Winnows the buxom Air;  till within soar
               Of Towering Eagles, to all the Fowls he seems
               A Ph??nix, gazed by all, as that sole 
Bird
               When to enshrine his relics in the Sun's
               Bright Temple, to ??gyptian Theb's he flies.
               At once on the Eastern cliff of Paradise
               
               He lights, and to his proper shape returns
               A Seraph winged; six wings he wore, to shade
               His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad
               Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast
               With regal Ornament; the middle pair
               Girt like a Starry Zone his waste, and round
               Skirted his loins and thighs with downy Gold
               And colours dipped in Heaven; the third his feet
               Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
               sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood,
               And shook his Plumes, that Heavenly fragrance filled
               The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the Bands
               Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
               And to his message high in honour rise;
               For on some message high they guest him bound.
               The glittering Tents he passed, and now is come
               Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrh,
               And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nerd, and Balm;
               A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
               Wantoned as in her prime, and plaid at will
               Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
               Wilde above Rule or Art; enormous bliss.
               Him through the spicy Forest onward come
               
                  Adam discerned, as in the door he sat
               Of his cool Bower, while now the mounted Sun
               Shot down direct his fervid Rays to warm
               Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam needs; 
               
               And Eve within, due at her hour prepared
               For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please
               True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
               Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,
               Berry or Grape: to whom thus Adam called.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve. 

               
            
            
               So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
               She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
               What choice to choose for delicacy best,
               What order, so contrived as not to mix
               Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring
               Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, 
               
               Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
               Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields
               In India East or West, or middle shore
               In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where
               
                  Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat,
               Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell
               She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board
               Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape
               She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meads
               From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed
               She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold
               Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground
               With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.
               Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet
               His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train
               Accompanied then with his own complete
               Perfections, in himself was all his state,
               More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits
               On Princes, when their rich Retinue long
               Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeared with Gold
               Dazzles the crowd, and sets them all agape.
               Nearer his presence Adam though not old,
               Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
               As to a superior Nature, bowing low,
            
            
               Thus said. 

               
            
            
               Whom thus the Angelic Virtue answered mild.
               
                  
 So to the Sylvan
Lodge
               They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smiled
               With flourets decked and fragrant smells; but Eve
               Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair
               Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned
               Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove,
               Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil
               She needed, Virtue-proof, no thought infirm
               Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail
               
               Bestowed, the holy salutation used
               Long after to blessed Marie, second Eve.
 Raised of

               Their Table was, and mossy seats had round,
               And on her ample Square from side to side

here
               Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;
               No fear lest Dinner cool; when thus began
               Our Author.

 So down
they sat,
               And to their viands fell, nor seemingly
               The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
               Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch
               Of real hunger, and concoctive heat 
               
               To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires
               Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire
               Of sooty coal the Empires Alchemist
               Can turn, or holds it possible to turn
               Metals of drossiest Ore to perfect Gold
               As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve
               
               Ministerd naked, and their flowing cups
               With pleasant liquors crowned: O innocence
               Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
               Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin
               Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts
               Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy
               Was understood, the injured Lovers Hell.
            
            
               Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,
               Not burdened Nature, sudden mind arose
               In Adam, not to let the occasion pass
               Given him by this great Conference to know
               Of things above his World, and of their being
               Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw
               Transcend his own so far, whose radiant forms
               Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far
               Exceeded human, and his wary speech
               Thus to the Empyreal Minister he framed.

               
            
            
               To whom the winged Hierarch replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the Patriarch of mankind replied,
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the Angel. 

               
            
            
               To whom our great Progenitor. 

               
            
            
               Thus Adam made request, and Raphael
               
               After short pause assenting, thus began.

               
            
            
               So spake The Omnipotent, and with his words
               All seemed well pleased, all seemed, but were not all.
               That day, as other solemn days, they spent
               In song and dance about the sacred Hill,
               Mystical dance, which yonder starry Sphere
               Of Planets and of fixed in all her Wheels
               Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
               Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular
               Then most, when most irregular they seem,
               And in their motions harmony Divine
               So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
               Listens delighted.  Evening now approached
               (For wee have also our Evening and our Morn,
               Wee ours for change delectable, not need)
               Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
               Desirous; all in Circles as they stood,
               Tables are set, and on a sudden piled
               With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows
               In Pearl, in Diamond, and massy Gold
               Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heaven.
               On flours reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,
               They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
               Quaff immortality and joy, secure
               Of surfeit where full measure only bounds
               Excess, before the all bounteous King, who showered
               With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. 
               
               Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhaled
               From that high mount of God, whence light &amp; shade
               Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed
               To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there
               In darker veil) and roseate Dews disposed
               All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,
               Wide over all the Plain, and wider far
               Then all this globous Earth in Plain out spread,
               (Such are the Courts of God) the Angelic throng
               Dispersed in Bands and Files their Camp extend
               By living Streams among the Trees of Life,
               Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,
               Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept
               Fannd with cool Winds, save those who in their course
               Melodious Hymns about the soverign Throne
               Alternate all night long: but not so waked
               
                  Satan, so call him now, his former name
               Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,
               If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,
               In favour and in pr??eminence, yet fraught
               With envy against the Son of God, that day
               Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed
               
                  Messiah King anointed, could not bear
               Through pride that sight, &amp; thought himself impaired.
               Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
               Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
               Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved
               With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave
               Unworshipt, unobeyed the Throne supreme
               Contemptuous, and his next subordinate
               Awning, thus to him in secret spake.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused
               Bad influence into th'unwarie breast
               Of his Associate; he together calls,
               Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,
               Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,
               That the most High commanding, now ere Night,
               Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heaven,
               The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;
               Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
               Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
               Or taint integrity; but all obeyed
               The wonted signal, and superior voice
               Of their great Potentate; for great indeed
               His name, and high was his degree in Heaven; 
               
               His countenance, as the Morning Star that guides
               The starry flock, allured them, and with lies
               Drew after him the third part of Heavens Host:
               Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns
               Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount
               And from within the golden Lamps that burn
               Nightly before him, saw without their light
               Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spread
               Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes
               Were banded to oppose his high Decree;
               And smiling to his only Son thus said.

               
            
            
               To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear
               Lightning Divine, ineffable, serene,
               Made answer. 

               
            
            
               So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers
               Far was advanced on winged speed, an Host
               Innumerable as the Stars of Night,
               Or Stars of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun
               Impearls on every leaf and every floor. 
               Regions they passed, the mighty Regencies
               Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
               In their triple Degrees, Regions to which
               All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more
               Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,
               And all the Sea, from one entire globose
               Stretched into Longitude; which having passed
               At length into the limits of the North
               They came, and Satan to his Royal seat
               High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount
               Raised on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towers
               From Diamond Quarries hewn, and Rocks of Gold,
               The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call
               That Structure in the Dialect of men
               Interpreted) which not long after, he
               Affecting all equality with God,
               In imitation of that Mount whereon
               
                  Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,
               The Mountain of the Congregation called;
               For thither he assembled all his Train,
               Pretending so commanded to consult
               About the great reception of their King,
               Thither to come, and with calumnious Art
               Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.

               
            
            
               Thus far his bold discourse without control
               Had audience, when among the Seraphim
               
                  Abdiel, then whom none with more zeal adored
               The Deity, and divine commands obeyed, 
               
               Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe
               The current of his fury thus opposed.

               
            
            
               So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeal
               None seconded, as out of season judged,
               Or singular and rash, whereat rejoiced
               the apostate, and more haughty thus replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               He said, and as the sound of waters deep
               Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
               Through the infinite Host, nor less for that
               The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
               Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.

               
            
            
               So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,
               Among the faithless, faithful only he;
               Among innumerable false, unmoved,
               unshaken, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd
               His Loyalty he kept, his Love, his Zeal;
               Nor number, nor example with him wrought
               To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind
               Though single. From amidst them forth he passed, 
               
               Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained
               Superior, nor of violence feared aught;
               And with retorted scorn his back he turned
               On those proud Towers to swift destruction doomed.

            Paradise Lost. Book VI.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
               Raphael continues to relate how Michael and
Gabriel were  sent forth to battle against Satan and
his Angels.  The  first Fight described: Satan and his
Powers retire under  Night: He calls a Council, invents devilish
Engines, which in the  second days Fight put Michael and his
Angels to some disorder;   but they at length pulling up Mountains
overwhelmed both the  force and Machins of Satan: Yet the
Tumult not so ending, God  on the third day sends Messiah his
Son, for whom he had  reserved the glory of that Victory: He in the
Power of his  Father coming to the place, and causing all his Legions to
stand  still on either side, with his Chariot and Thunder driving into 
the midst of his Enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards  the
wall of Heaven;  which opening, they leap down with horror  and
confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in  the Deep:
Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.
            
            

            
               DEscend from Heaven Urania, by that
name
               If rightly thou art called, whose Voice divine
               Following, above theOlympian Hill I soar,
               Above the flight of Pegasean wing.
               The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou
               Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
               Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heavenly borne,
               Before the Hills appeared, or Fountain flowed,
               
               Thou with Eternal wisdom did converse,
               Wisdom thy Sister, and with her did play
               In presence of the almighty Father, pleased
               With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee
               Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
               An Earthly Guest, and drawn Imperial Air,
               Thy tampering; with like safety guided down
               Return me to my Native Element:
               Least from this flying Steed unreingned, (as once
               
                  Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime)
               Dismounted, on theAleian Field I fall
               Erroneous there to wander and forlorn.
               Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
               Within the visible Diurnal Sphere;
               Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,
               More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchanged
               To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
               On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;
               In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
               And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
               Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn
               Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,
               
                  Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
               But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
               Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race
               Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard
               In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Ears
               To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned
               Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend
               Her Son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
               For thou are Heavenly, she an empty dream.
            
            
               Say Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,
               The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned
               
                  Adam by dire example to beware 
               
               Apostasy, by what befell in Heaven
               To those Apostates, least the like befall
               In Paradise to Adam or his Race,
               Charged not to touch the interdicted Tree,
               If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
               So easily obeyed amid the choice
               Of all tastes else to please their appetite,
               Though wandering.  He with his consorted Eve
               
               The story heard attentive, and was filled
               With admiration, and deep Muse to hear
               Of things so high and strange, things to their thought
               So unimaginable as hate in Heaven,
               And War so near the Peace of God in bliss
               With such confusion: but the evil soon
               Driven back redounded as a flood on those
               From whom it sprung, impossible to mix
               With Blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed
               The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
               Led on, yet sunless, with desire to know
               What nearer might concern him, how this World
               Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began,
               When, and whereof created, for what cause,
               What within Eden or without was done
               Before his memory, as one whose drouth
               Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
               Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
               Proceeded thus to ask his Heavenly Guest.

               
            
            
               Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought:
            
            
               And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
                  
               
               
                  

            THE Angel ended, and in Adams Ear
            So Charming left his voice, that he a while
            Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;
            Then as new waked thus gratefully replied.
            
               

            
            
               So spake our Sire, and by his countenance seemed
               Entering on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve
               
               Perceiving where she sat retired in sight,
               With lowliness Majestic from her seat,
                  
               
               And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
               Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,
               To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,
               Her Nursery; they at her coming sprung
               And touched by her fair tendency gladlier grew.
               Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
               Delighted, or not capable her ear
               Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,
               
                  Adam relating, she sole Auditress;
               Her Husband the Relater she preferred
               Before the Angel, and of him to ask
               Chose rather; he, she knew would intermix
               Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
               With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip
               Not Words alone pleased her.  O when meet now
               Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joined?
               With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;
               Not unattended, for on her as Queen
               A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
               And from about her shot Darts of desire
               Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.
               And Raphael now to Atom's doubt proposed
               Benevolent and facile thus replied.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt, replied.
               
                  
 To whom thus Raphael
answered heavenly meek.

               
            
            
               So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
               
                  
 To whom the Angel with contracted
brow. 

               
            
            
               To whom thus half abashed Adam replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
               Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,
               Answered. 

               
            
            
               So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus
               Followed with benediction. 

               
            
            
               So parted they, the Angel up to Heaven
               From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bower.

            Paradise Lost. BOOK IX
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
               Satan having compassed the Earth, with meditated guile
returns as  a mist by Night into Paradise, enters into the
Serpent sleeping. 
Adam and Eve in the Morning go forth to their
labours, which 
Eve proposes to divide in several places, each labouring
apart: 
Adam conscents not, alleging the danger, lest that Enemy,
 of whom they were forewarned, should attempt her found alone:  
Eve loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges 
her going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her 
strength; Adam at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone;
his  subtle aproach, first gazing, then speaking, with much  flattery
extolling Eve above all other Creatures. Eve 
wondering to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he atcoined to  human
speech and such understanding not till now; the Serpent  answers, that
by tasting of a certain Tree in the Garden he  attained both to Speech
and Reason, till then void of each;  
Eve requires him  to bring her to that  Tree, and
finds it to be the Tree of Knowledge forbidden: The  Serpent now grow
bolder, with many wiles and arguments induces  her at length to eat; she
pleased with the taste deliberates a  while whether to impart thereof to
Adam or not, at last brings  him of the Fruit, relates what
persuaded her to eat thereof: 
Adam at first amazed, but persieving her lost, resolves 
through vehemence of love to perish with her; and extenuating the 
trespass eats also of the Fruit: The Effects thereof in them  both; they
seek to cover their nakedness; then fall to  variance and accusation
of one another.
            

            
               NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest
               With Man, as with his Friend, familiar used
               To sit indulgent, and with him partake
               Rural repast, permitting him the while
               Venial discourse unblamed: I now must change
               Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach
               Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,
               And disobedience: On the part of Heaven
               Now alienated, distance and distaste,
               Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,
               That brought into this World a world of woe,
               Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery
               Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument
               Not less but more Heroic then the wrath
               Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursued
               Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage
               Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd,
               Or Neptun's ire or Juno's, that so long
               Perplexed the Greek and Cytherea's Son;
               If answerable style I can obtain
               Of my Celestial Patroness, who deigns
                  
               
               Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
               And dictates to me slumbering, or inspires
               Easy my unpremeditated Verse:
               Since first this Subject for Heroic Song
               Pleased me long choosing, and beginning late;
               Not sedulous by Nature to entice
               Wars, hitherto the only Argument
               Heroic deemed, chief maistrie to dissect
               With long and tedious havoc fabled Knights
               In Battles feigned; the better fortitude
               Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom
               Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,
               Or tilting Furniture, emblazoned Shields,
               Impress quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;
               Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgeous Knights
               At Joust and Torneament; then marshalled Feast
               Served up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;
               The skill of Artifice or Office mean,
               Not that which justly gives Heroic name
               To Person or to Poem.  Me of these
               Nor skilled nor studious, higher Argument
               Remains, sufficient of it self to raise
               That name, unless an age too late, or cold
               Climate, or Years damp my intended wing
               Depressed, and much they may, if all be mine,
               Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.
            
            
               The Sun was sunk, and after him the Star
               Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring
               Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter
               between Day and Night, and now from end to end
               Nights Hemisphere had veiled the Horizon round:
               When Satan who late fled before the threats
               Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved
               In meditated fraud and malice, bent
               
               On mans destruction, maugre what might hap
               Of heavier on himself, fearless returned.
               By Night he fled, and at Midnight returned
               From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,
               Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descried
               His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim
               That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,
               The space of seven continued Nights he rode
               With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line
               He circled, four times crossed the Carr of Night
               From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;
               On the eighth returned, and on the Coast averse
               From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth
               Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
               Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wrought the change,
               Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
               
               Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part
               Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;
               In with the River sunk, and with it rose
               Satan involved in rising Mist, then sought
               Where to lie hid; Sea he had searched and Land
               From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole
               
                  M??otis, up beyond the River Obe;
               Downward as far Antartic; and in length
               West from Orontes to the Ocean barred
               At Darien, thence to the Land where flows
               
                  Ganges and Induce: thus the Orb he roamed
               With narrow search; and with inspection deep
               Considered every Creature, which of all
               Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found
               The Serpent subtlest Beast of all the Field.
               Him after long debate, irresolute
               Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose
               Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom
               
               To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
               From sharpest sight: for in the wily Snake,
               Whatever slights none would suspicious mark,
               As from his wit and native subtlety
               Proceeding, which in other Beasts observed
               Doubt might beget of Diabolic power
               Active within beyond the sense of brute.
               Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief
               His bursting passion into plaints thus poured:

               
            
            
               So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Dry,
               Like a black mist low creeping, he held on
               His midnight search, where soonest he might find
               The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found
               In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld,
               His head the midst, well stored with subtle wiles:
               Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,
               Nor nocent yet, but on the grassy Herb
               Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth
               The Devil entered, and his brutal sense,
               In heart or head, possessing soon inspired
               With act intelligential; but his sleep
               Disturbed not, waiting close th'approach of Morn.
               
               Now when as sacred Light began to dawn
               In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathed
               Their morning incense, when all things that breath,
               From th'Earths great Altar send up silent praise
               To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill
               With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair
               And joint their vocal Worship to the Quire
               Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake
               The season, prime for sweetest Scents and Aires:
               Then commune how that day they best may ply
               Their growing work: for much their work outgrew
               The hands dispatch of two Gardening so wide.
               And Eve first to her Husband thus began.

               
            
            
               To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the Virgin Majesty of Eve,
               As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
               With sweet austeer composure thus replied,

               
            
            
               To whom with healing words Adam replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So spake domestic Adam in his care
               And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought
               Less attributed to her Faith sincere,
               Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Adam fervently replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So spake the Patriarch of Mankind, but Eve
               
               Persisted, yet submiss, though last, replied.
 Thus saying, from her Husbands hand
her hand
               Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light
               
                  Oread or Dryad, or 
of Delia's Train,
               Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self
               In gate surpassed and Goddess-like deport,
               Though not as she with Bow and Quiver armed,
               But with such Gardening Tools as Art yet rude,
               Guiltless of fire had formed, or Angels brought.
               To Pales, or Pomona thus adorned,
               Likeliest she seemed, Pomona when she fled
               
                  Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime,
               
               Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
               Her long with ardent look his Eye pursued
               Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
               Oft he to her his charge of quick return
               Repeated, she to him as oft engaged
               To be returned by Noon amid the Bower,
               And all things in best order to invite
               Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.
               O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,
               Of thy presumed return! event perverse!
               Thou never from that hour in Paradise
               
               Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
               Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades
               To intercept thy way, or send thee back
               Despoiled of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.
               For now, and since first break of dawn the Fiend,
               Mere Serpent in appearance, forth was come,
               And on his Quest, where likeliest he might find
               The only two of Mankind, but in them
               The whole included Race, his purposed prey.
               In Bower and Field he sought, where any tuft
               Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,
               Their tendency or Plantation for delight,
               By Fountain or by shady Rivulet
               He sought them both, but wished his hap might find
               
                  Eve separate, he wished, but not with hope
               Of what so seldom chanced, when to his wish,
               Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
               Veiled in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,
               Half spied, so thick the Roses bushing round
               About her glowd, oft stooping to support
               Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay
               Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,
                  
               
               Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies
               Gently with Myrtle band, mindless the while,
               Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,
               From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
               Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed
               Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palm,
               Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen
               Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours
               Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:
               Spot more delicious then those Gardens feigned
               Or of revived Atones, or renowned
               
                  Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son,
               Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King
               Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian Spouse.
               Much he the Place admired, the Person more.
               As one who long in populous City pent,
               Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Air,
               Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe
               Among the pleasant Villages and Farms
               Adjoynd, from each thing met conceives delight,
               The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,
               Or Dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;
               If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,
               What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more,
               She most, and in her look sums all Delight.
               Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold
               This flowery Plat, the sweet recess of Eve
               
               Thus early, thus alone; her Heavenly form
               Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,
               Her graceful Innocence, her every Air
               Of gesture or lest action overawd
               His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved
               His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
               That space the Evil one abstracted stood
               
               From his own evil, and for the time remained
               Stupidly good, of enmity disarmed,
               Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge;
               But the hot Hell that always in him burns,
               Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,
               And tortures him now more, the more he sees
               Of pleasure not for him ordained: then soon
               Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
               Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.

               
            
            
               So spake the Enemy of Mankind, enclosed
               In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve
               
               Addressed his way, not with indented wave,
               Prone on the ground, as since, but on his rear,
                  
               
               Circular base of rising folds, that tour'd
               Fouled above fouled a surging Maze, his Head
               Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;
               With burnished Neck of verdant Gold, erect
               Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass
               Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape,
               And lovely, never since of Serpent kind
               Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed
               
                  Hermione and Cadmus, or the God
               In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed
               
                  Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen,
               He with Olympias, this with her who bore
               
                  Scipio the height of Rome.  With tract oblique
               At first, as one who sought access, but feared
               To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
               As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought
               Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind
               Verse oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Sail;
               So varied he, and of his tortuous Train
               Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
               To lure her Eye; she busied heard the sound
               Of rustling Leaves, but minded not, as used
               To such disport before her through the Field,
               From every Beast, more duteous at her call,
               Then at Circean call the Herd disguised.
               He boulder now, uncalled before her stood;
               But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd
               His turret Crest, and sleek enamelled Neck,
               Fawning, and licked the ground whereon she trod.
               His gentle dumb expression turned at length
               The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad
               Of her attention gained, with Serpent Tongue
               Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,
               His fraudulent temptation thus began.
                  

               
            
            
               So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tuned;
               Into the Heart of Eve his words made way,
               Though at the voice much marvelling; at length
               Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve
               
               Yet more amazed unwary thus replied.

               
            
            
               To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.
               
                  
 said Eve. 
He leading  swiftly rolled
               In tangles, and made intricate seem strait,
               To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy
               
               Brightens his Crest, as when a wandering Fire,
               Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night
               Condenses, and the cold environs round,
               Kindled through agitation to a Flame,
               Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends
               Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,
               Misleads the amazed Night-wanderer from his way
               To Bogs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole,
               There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.
               So glister'd the dire Snake, and into fraud
               Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree
               Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
               Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.

               
            
            
               To whom the Tempter guileful replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve yet sunless.

               
            
            
               She scarce had said, though brief, when now more  bold
               The Tempter, but with show of Zeal and Love
               To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
               New part puts on, and as to passion moved,
               
               Fluctuats disturbed, yet comely and in act
               Raised, as of some great matter to begin.
               As when of old some Orator renound
               In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence
               Flourished, since mute, to some great cause addressed,
               Stood in himself collected, while each part,
               Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,
               Sometimes in height began, as no delay
               Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.
               So standing, moving, or to height upgrown
               The Tempter all impassiond thus began.

               
            
            
               He ended, and his words replete with guile
               Into her heart too easy entrance won:
               Fixed on the Fruit she gazed, which to behold
               
               Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound
               Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregn'd
               With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;
               Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and waked
               An eager appetite, raised by the smell
               So savoury of that Fruit, which with desire,
               Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
               Solicited her longing eye; yet first
               Pausing a while, thus to her self she mused.

               
            
            
               So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
               Forth reaching to the Fruit, she plucked, she eat:
               Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
               Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,
               That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk
               The guilty Serpent, and well might, for Eve
               
               Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else
               Regarded, such delight till then, as seemed,
               In Fruit she never tasted, whether true
               Or fancied so, through expectation high
               Of knowledge, nor was God-head from her thought.
               Greedily she ingorged without restraint,
               And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,
               And heightened as with Wine, jocund and boon,
               Thus to her self she pleasingly began.

               
            
            
               So saying, from the Tree her step she turned,
               But first low Reverence don, as to the power
               That dwelt within, whose presence had infused
               Into the plant sciential sap, derived
               
               From Nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while
               Waiting desirous her return, had wove
               Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorn
               Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown,
               As Reapers oft are wont their Harvest Queen.
               Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new
               Solace in her return, so long delayed;
               Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,
               Misgive him; he the faltering measure felt;
               And forth to meet her went, the way she took
               That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree
               Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,
               Scarce from the Tree returning; in her hand
               A bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled,
               New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
               To him she hasted, in her face excuse
               Came Prologue, and Apology to prompt,
               Which with bland words at will she thus addressed.

               
            
            
               Thus Eve with Countenance blithe her story told;
               But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowed.
               On the other side, Adam, soon as he heard
               The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amazed,
               Astonished stood and Blank, while horror chill
               Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;
               From his slack hand the Garland wreathed for Eve
               
               Down dropped, and all the faded Roses shed:
               Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
               First to himself he inward silence broke.
 So having said, as one from sad
dismay
               Recomfort, and after thoughts disturbed
               Submitting to what seemed remediless,
               Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turned.

               
            
            
               So Adam, and thus Eve to him replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So saying, she embraced him, and for joy
               Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love
               Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur
               Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.
               In recompense (for such compliance bad
               Such recompense best merits) from the bough
               She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit
               With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat
               Against his better knowledge, not deceived,
               But fondly overcome with Female charm.
               Earth trembled from her entrails, as again
               In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,
               Sky lowered and muttering Thunder, some sad drops
               Wept at completing of the mortal Sin
               Original; while Adam took no thought,
               Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate
               Her former trespass feared, the more to soothe
               Him with her loved society, that now
               
               As with new Wine intoxicated both
               They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel
               Divinity within them breeding wings
               Where to to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit
               Far other operation first displayed,
               Carnal desire inflaming, he on Eve
               
               Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him
               As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burn:
               Till Adam thus'gan Eve to dalliance move,

               
            
            
               So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
               Of amorous intent, well understood
               Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.
               Her hand he seized, and to a shady bank,
               Thick overhead with verdant roof embowered
               He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,
               Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,
               And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.
                  
               
               There they their fill of Love and Loves disport
               Took largely, of their mutual guilt the Seal,
               The solace of their sin, till dewy sleep
               Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play.
               Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,
               That with exhilarating vapour bland
               About their spirits had plaid, and inmost powers
               Made err, was now exhaled, and grosser sleep
               Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
               Encumbered, now had left them, up they rose
               As from unrest, and each the other viewing,
               Soon found their Eyes how opened, and their minds
               How darkened; innocence, that as a veil
               Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gon,
               Just confidence, and native righteousness
               And honour from about them, naked left
               To guilty shame he covered, but his Robe
               Uncovered more, so rose the Danite strong
               
                  Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap
               Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked
               Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare
               Of all their virtue: silent, and in face
               Confounded long they sate, as stricken mute,
               Till Adam, though not less then Eve abashed,
               At length gave utterance to these words constrained.

               
            
            
               So counselled he, and both together went
               Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose
               The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renowned,
               But such as at this day to Indians known
               In Malabar or Deacon spreads her Arms
               Branching so broad and long, that in the ground
               The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow
               About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade
               High overarched, and echoing Walks between;
               There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heat
               Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing Herds
                  
               
               At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves
               They gathered, broad as Amazonian Cargo,
               And with what skill they had, together sowed,
               To gird their waste, vain Covering if to hide
               Their guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike
               To that first naked Glory.  Such of late
               
                  Columbus found theAmerican so girt
               With feathered Cincture, naked else and wilde
               Among the Trees on Isles and woody Shores.
               Thus fenced, and as they thought, their shame in part
               Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,
               They sate them down to weep, nor only Tears
               Reined at their Eyes, but high Winds worse within
               Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,
               Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore
               Their inward State of Mind, calm Region once
               And full of Peace, now tossed and turbulent:
               For Understanding ruled not, and the Will
               Heard not her lore, both in subjection now
               To sensual Appetite, who from beneath
               Usurping over soverign Reason claimed
               Superior sway: from thus distempered breast,
               
                  Adam, estranged in look and altered stile,
               Speech intermittent thus to Eve renewed.

               
            
            
               To whom soon moved with touch of blame thus Eve.
               
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom then first incensed Adam replied,
               
                  

               
            
            
               Thus they in mutual accusation spent
               The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
               And of their vain contest appeared no end.

               Paradise Lost. BOOK X.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            Mans transgression known, the Guardian Angels forsake
Paradise, and return up to Heaven to approve  their
vigilance, and are approved, God declaring that The entrance  of Satan
could not be by them prevented. He sends his Son to  judge the
Transgressors, who descends and gives Sentence  accordingly; then
in pity clothes them both, and rescinds. Sin  and Death
sitting till then at the Gates of Hell, by wondrous  simonpathie
feeling the success of Satan in this new World,  and the sin
by Man there committed, resolve to sit no longer  confined in Hell, but
to follow Satan their Sire up to the place  of Man: To make the
way easier from Hell to this World to and  fro, they pave a broad Highway
or Bridge over Chaos,  according to the Track that Satan
first made; then preparing  for Earth, they meet him proud of his
success returning to Hell;  their mutual gratulation. Satan
arrives at Pandemonium,  in full of assembly relates with
boasting his                        
 success against Man; instead of  applause is entercoined
with a general hiss by all his  audience, tranceformed with himself
also suddenly into  Serpents, according to his doom given in       
                          
Paradise; then deluded with a show of the  forbidden Tree
springing up before them, they greedily reaching  to take  of the Fruit,
chew dust and bitter ashes.  The  proceedings of Sin and Death;
God foretells the final Victory  of his Son over them, and the renewing
of all things; but for the  present commands his Angels to make several
altartions in  the Heavens and Elements. Adam more and
more perceiving his  fallen condition heavily bewails, rejects the
consolement of 
Eve; she persists and at length appeases him: then to evade
the  Curse likely to fall on their Offspring, proposes to Adam
violent  ways which he approves not, but conceiving better hope, puts
her  in mind of the late Promise made them, that her Seed should be 
revenged on the Serpent, and exhorts her with him to seek Peace  of the
offended Deity, by repentance and supplication.
            

            
               MEanwhile the heinous and despiteful act
               Of Satan done in Paradise, and how
               He in the Serpent, had perverted Eve,
               Her Husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,
               Was known in Heaven; for what can escape the Eye
               Of God All-seeing, or deceive his Heart
               Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,
               Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind
               Of Man, with strength entire, and free will armed,
               Complete to have discovered and repulsed
               Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.
               For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered
               The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,
               
               Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
               Incurred, what could they less, the penalty,
               And manifold in sin, deserved to fall.
               Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
               the Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad
               For Man, for of his state by this they knew,
               Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
               Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news
               From Earth arrived at Heaven Gate, displeased
               All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare
               That time Celestial visages, yet mixed
               With pity, violated not their bliss.
               About the new-arrived, in multitudes
               the Ethereal People ran, to hear and know
               How all befell: they towards the Throne Supreme
               Accountable made haste to make appear
               With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance,
               And easily approved; when the most High
               Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,
               Amidst in Thunder uttered thus his voice.

               
            
            
               So spake the Father, and unfolding bright
               Toward the right hand his Glory, on the Son
               Blazed forth unclouded Deity; he full
               Resplendent all his Father manifest
               Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.

               
            
            
               Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose
               Of high collateral glory: him Thrones and Powers,
               Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant
               Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence
               
                  Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay.
               Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods
               Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.
               Now was the Sun in Western cadence low
               From Noon, and gentle Aires due at their hour
               To fan the Earth now waked, and usher in
               The Evening cool when he from wrath more cool
               Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both
               To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard
               Now walking in the Garden, by soft winds
               Brought to their Ears, while day declined, they heard,
               And from his presence hid themselves among
               The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God
               Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.
 He came, and with him Eve,
more loath, though first
               To offend, discountenanced both, and discomposed;
               Love was not in their looks, either to God
               Or to each other, but apparent guilt,
               And shame, and perturbation, and despair,
               Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.
               Whence Adam faltering long, thus answered brief.

To whom
               The gracious judge without revile replied.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Adam sore beset  replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom the soverign Presence thus replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So having said, he thus to Eve in  few:
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelmed,
               Confessing soon, yet not before her judge
               Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.

               
            
            
               Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
               To Judgement he proceeded on the accused
               Serpent though brute, unable to transfer
               The Guilt on him who made him instrument
               Of mischief, and polluted from the end
               Of his Creation; justly then accursed,
               As vitiated in Nature: more to know
               Concerned not Man (since he no further knew)
               Nor altered his offence; yet God at last
               To Satan first in sin his doom applied,
               Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:
               And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.

               
            
            
               So spake this Oracle, then verified
               When Jesus son of Mary second Eve,
               Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heaven,
                  
               
               Prince of the Air; then rising from his Grave
               Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumph
               In open show, and with ascention bright
               Captivity led captive through the Air,
               The Realm it self of Satan long usurped,
               Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
               Even he who now foretold his fatal bruise,
               And to the Woman thus his Sentence turned.
               
                  

               
            
            
               On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,
               And th'instant stroke of Death denounced that day
               Removed far off; then pitying how they stood
               Before him naked to the air, that now
               Must suffer change, disdained not to begin
               Thenceforth the form of servant to assume,
               As when he washed his servants feet so now
               As Father of his Family he clad
               Their nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,
               Or as the Snake with youthful Coat repaid;
               
               And thought not much to cloth his Enemies:
               Nor he their outward only with the Skins
               Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more
               Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,
               Arraying covered from his Fathers sight.
               To him with swift ascent he up returned,
               Into his blissful bosom reassumed
               In glory as of old, to him appeased
               All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man
               Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
               Meanwhile ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,
               Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,
               In counterview within the Gates, that now
               Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
               Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,
               Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.

               
            
            
               Whom thus the meagre Shadow answered soon.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell
               Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock
               Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,
               Against the day of Battle, to a Field,
               Where Armies lie encamped, come flying, lured
               With sent of living Carcasses designed
               For death, the following day, in bloody fight.
               So scented the grim Feature, and upturned
               His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,
               Sagacious of his Quarry from so far.
               Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste
               Wide Anarchy of Chaos damp and dark
               Flew divers, and with Power (their Power was great)
               Hovering upon the Waters; what they met
               Solid or slimy, as in raging Sea
               
               Tossed up and down, together crowded drove
               From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.
               As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse
               Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive
               Mountains of Ice, that stop th'imagin'd way
               Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich
               
                  Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soil
               Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,
               As with a Trident smote, and fixed as firm
               As Delos floating once; the rest his look
               Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move,
               And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the 
Gate,
               Deep to the Roots of Hell the gathered beach
               They fastened, and the Mole immense wrought on
               Over the foaming deep high Arched, a Bridge
               Of length prodigious joining to the Wall
               Immovable of this now fenceless world
               Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
               Smooth, easy, inoffensive down to Hell.
               So, if great things to small may be compared,
               
                  Xerxes, the Liberty of Greece to yoke,
               From Suss his Memnonian Palace high
               Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont
               
               Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,
               And scourged with many a stroke th'indignant waves.
               Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art
               Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock
               Over the vexed Abyss, following the track
               Of Satan, to the self same place where he
               First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe
               From out of Chaos to the out side bare
               Of this round World: with Pins of Adamant
               And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made
               And durable; and now in little space
                  
               
               The confines met of Empyrean Heaven
               And of this World, and on the left hand Hell
               With long reach interposed; three several ways
               In sight, to each of these three places led.
               And now their way to Earth they had descried,
               To Paradise first tending, when behold
               
                  Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
               Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
               His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries
rose:
               Disguised he came, but those his Children dear
               Their Parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
               He after Eve seduced, unminded slunk
               Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape
               To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
               By Eve, though all unwitting, seconded
               Upon her Husband, saw their shame that sought
               Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
               The Son of God to judge them terrified
               He fled, not hoping to escape, but shun
               The present, fearing guilty what his wrath
               Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned
               By Night, and listening where the hapless Pair
               Sate in their sad discourse, and various plaint,
               Thence gathered his own doom, which understood
               Not instant, but of future time.  With joy
               And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned,
               And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot
               Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't
               Met who to meet him came, his Offspring dear.
               Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight
               Of that stupendous Bridge his joy increased.
               Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair
               Enchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.
               
                  

               
            
            
               Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answered glad.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So saying he dismissed them, they with speed
               Their course through thickest Constellations held
               Spreading their bane; the blasted Stars looked wan,
               And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclipse
               Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down
               The Casey to Hell Gate; on either side
               Disported Chaos over built exclaimed,
               And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,
               That scorned his indignation: through the Gate,
               Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,
               And all about found desolate; for those
               Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,
               
               Flown to the upper World; the rest were all
               Far to the inland retired, about the walls
               Of Pand??monium, City and proud seat
               Of Lucifer, so by allusion called,
               Of that bright Star to Satan paragond.
               There kept their Watch the Legions, while the Grand
               In Council sate, solicitous what chance
               Might intercept their Emperor sent, so he
               Departing gave command, and they observed.
               As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe
               By Astracan over the Snowy Plains
               Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the horns
               Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond
               The Realm of Aladule, in his retreat
               To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late
               Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell
               Many a dark League, reduced in careful Watch
               Round their Metropolis, and now expecting
               Each hour their great adventurer from the search
               Of Foreign Worlds: he through the midst unmarked,
               In show Plebeian Angel militant
               Of lowest order, past; and from the door
               Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible
               Ascended his high Throne, which under state
               Of richest texture spread, at th'upper end
               Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while
               He sate, and round about him saw unseen:
               At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head
               And shape Star bright appeared, or brighter, clad
               With what permissive glory since his fall
               Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed
               At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
               Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,
               Their mighty Chief returned: loud was th'acclaime:
               
               Forth rushed in haste the great consulting Peers,
               Raised from their Dark Divan, and with 
like joy
               Congratulant approached him, who with hand
               Silence, and with these words attention won.

               
            
            
               So having said, a while he stood, expecting
               Their universal shout and high applause
               To fill his ear, when contrary he hears
               On all sides, from innumerable tongues
               A dismal universal hiss, the sound
               Of public scorn; he wondered, but not long
               Had leisure, wondering at himself now more;
               His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
               His Arms clung to his Ribs, his Legs entwining
               Each other, till supplanted down he fell
               A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,
               Reluctant, but in vain, a greater power
               Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,
               According to his doom: he would have spoke,
               But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
               To forked tongue, for now were all transformed
               Alike, to Serpents all as accessories
               To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din
               Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now
               With complicated monsters head and tail,
               
               Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisb??na 
dire,
               
                  Cerastes hornd, Hydrus,
and Ellops drier,
               And Dipsas (not so thick swarmed once the 
Soil
               Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle
               
                  Ophiusa) but still greatest he the midst,
               Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun
               Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime,
               Huge Python, and his Power no less he seemed
               Above the rest still to retain; they all
               Him followed issuing forth to th'open Field,
               Where all yet left of that revolted Rout
               heaven fallen, in station stood or just array,
               Sublime with expectation when to see
               ln Triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;
               They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd
               Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,
               And horrid sympathy; for what they saw,
               They felt themselves now changing; down their arms,
               Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,
               And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form
               Caught by Contagion, like in punishment,
               As in their crime.  Thus was th'applause they meant,
               Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
               Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood
               A Grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,
               His will who reigns above, to aggravate
               Their penance, laden with Fruit like that
               Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve
               
               Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
               Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining
               For one forbidden Tree a multitude
               Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;
               Yet parcht with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,
               Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,
               
               But on they rolled in heaps, and up the Trees
               Climbing, sat thicker then the snaky locks
               That curled Meg??ra: greedily they plucked
               The fruit fair to sight, like that which grew
               Near that bituminous Lake where Sodom flamed;
               This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
               Deceived; they fondly thinking to allay
               Their appetite with gust, instead of Fruit
               Showed bitter Ashes, which th'offended taste
               With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,
               Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,
               With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
               With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell
               Into the same illusion, not as Man
               Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued
               And worn with Famine, long and ceaseless hiss,
               Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed,
               Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo
               This annual humbling certain numbered days,
               To dash their pride, and joy for Man seduced.
               However some tradition they dispersed
               Among the Heathen of their purchase got,
               And Fabled how the Serpent, whom they called
               
                  Ophion with Eurynome, the wide-
               Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
               Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven
               And Ops, ere yet Dictaelig;an Jove was born.
               Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
               Too soon arrived, Sin there in power before,
               Once actual, now in body, and to dwell
               Habitual habitant; behind her Death
               
               Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
               On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began.

               
            
            
               Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answered soon.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom th'incestuous Mother thus replied.

               
            
            
               This said, they both betook them several ways,
               Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
               All kinds, and for destruction to mature
               Sooner or later; which the almighty seeing,
               From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,
               To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.

               
            
            
               He ended, and the heavenly Audience loud
               Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas,
               Through multitude that sung: 
  Such
was their song,
               While the Creator calling forth by name
               His mighty Angels gave them several charge,
               As sorted best with present things.  The Sun
               Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
               As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
               Scarce tolerable, and from the North to call
               Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring
               Solstitial summers heat.  To the blanc Moon
               Her office they prescribed, to the other five
               Their planetary motions and aspects
               In Sextile, Square, 
and Trine, and                                  
                
Opposite,
               
               Of noxious efficacy, and when to join
               In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixed
               Their influence malignant when to shower,
               Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,
               Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set
               Their corners, when with bluster to confound
               Sea, Air, and Shore, the Thunder when to roll
               With terror through the dark Aerial Hall.
               Some say he bid his Angels turn askance
               The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
               From the Suns Axle; they with labour pushed
               Oblique the Centres Globe: Some say the Sun
               Was bid turn Reins from th'Equinoctial Rode
               Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seven
               
                  Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins
               Up to the Tropic 
                  Crab;  thence
down amain
               By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales,
               As deep as Capricorn, to bring in change
               Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring
               Perpetual smiled on Earth with vernant Flours,
               Equal in Days and Nights, except to those
               Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day
               Had unbenighted shone, while the low Sun
               To recompense his distance, in their sight
               Had rounded still theHorizon, and not  known
               Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow
               From cold Estotiland, and South as far
               Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted Fruit
               The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turned
               His course intended; else how had the World
               Inhabited, though sunless, more then now,
               Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
               These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced
               Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,
               
               Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,
               Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North
               Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore
               Bursting their brazen Dungeon, armed with ice
               And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw,
               
                  Bores and C??cias and Argestes
loud
               And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn;
               With adverse blast upturns them from the South
               
                  Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds
               From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce
               Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Winds
               
                  Eurus and Zephir with their lateral noise,
               
                  Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began
               Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first
               Daughter of Sin, among th'irrational,
               Death introduced through fierce antipathy:
               Beast now with Beast began war, and Foul with Foul,
               And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,
               Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe
               Of Man, but fled him, or with countenance grim
               Glared on him passing: these were from without
               The growing miseries, which Adam saw
               Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
               To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within,
               And in a troubled Sea of passion tossed,
               Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.

               
            
            
               Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
               Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell,
               Wholesome and cool, and mild, but with black Air
               Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,
               Which to his evil Conscience represented
               All things with double terror: On the Ground
               Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground, and oft
               Cursed his Creation, Death as oft accused
               Of tardy execution, since denounced
               The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,
               Said he, with one thrice acceptable stroke
               To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
               Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
               But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine
               Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.
               O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowers,
               With other echo late I taught your Shades
               To answer, and resound far other Song.
               Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld,
                  
               
               Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,
               Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:
               But her with stern regard he thus repelled.

               
            
            
               He added not, and from her turned, but Eve
               
               Not so repulsed, with Tears that ceased not flowing,
               And tresses all disordered, at his feet
               Fell humble, and embracing them, besought
               His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.

               
            
            
               She ended weeping, and her lowly plight,
               Immovable till peace obtained from fault
               Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought
               Commiseration; soon his heart relented
               Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,
               Now at his feet submissive in distress,
               Creature so fair his reconciling seeking,
               His counsel whom she had displeased, his aide;
               As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,
               And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               She ended hear, or vehement despair
               Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts
               Had entertained, as died her Cheeks with pale.
               But Adam with such counsel nothing swayed,
               To better hopes his more attentive mind
               Labouring had raised, and thus to Eve replied.

               
            
            
               So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve
               
               Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place
               Repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
               Before him reverent, and both confessed
               
               Humbly their faults, and pardon begged, with tears
               Watering the ground, and with their sighs the Air
               Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
               Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.

               Paradise Lost. BOOK XI.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            The Son of God presents to his Father the Prayers of our
first Parents now repenting, and intercedes for them: God accepts them,
but declares that they must no longer abide in Paradise;
sends Michael with a Band of Cherubim to dispossess them; but
first to reveal to Adam future things: Michaels
coming down. Adam shows to
Eve certain ominous signs; he discerns Michaels
approach, goes out to meet him: the Angel denounces their departure.
Eve's Lamenttion. Adam pleads, but submits:
The Angel leads him up to a high Hill, sets before him in vision what
shall happ'n till the Flood.
            

            
               THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
               Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
               Prevenient Grace descending had removed
               The stony from their hearts, &amp; made new flesh
               Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breathed
               
               Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
               Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
               Then loudest Oratory: yet their port
               Not of mean suitors, nor important less
               Seemed their Petition, then when th'ancient Pair
               In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
               
                  Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
               The Race of Mankind drowned, before the Shrine
               Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers
               Flew up, nor mist the way, by envious winds
               Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed
               Dimentionless through Heavenly doors; then clad
               With incense, where the Golden Altar fumed,
               By their great Intercessor, came in sight
               Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
               Presenting, thus to intercede began.

               
            
            
               To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.

               
            
            
               He ended, and the Son gave signal high
               To the bright Minister that watched, he blew
 His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
               When God descended, and perhaps once more
               To sound at general Doom.  the Angelic blast
               Filled all the Regions: from their blissful Bowers
               Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,
               By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
               In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
               Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
               And took their Seats; till from his Throne supreme
               the almighty thus pronounced his soverign Will.

               
            
            
               He ceased; and th'Archangelic Power prepared
               For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
               Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
               Had, like a double Janus, all their shape
               Spangled with eyes more numerous then those
               Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,
               Charmed with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
               Of Harms, or his opiate Rod.  Mean while
               To resolute the World with sacred Light
               
                  Leucothea waked, and with fresh dews imbalmd
               The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve
               
               Had ended now their Orisons, and found
               Strength added from above, new hope to spring
               Out of despair, joy, but with fear yet linked;
               Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
               
                  

               
            
            
               So spake, so wished much-humbled Eve, but Fate
               Subscribed not; Nature first gave Signs, impressed
               On Bird, Beast, Air, Air suddenly eclipsed
               After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
               The Bird of Jove, stooped from his aerie tour,
               Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
               Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
               First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,
               Goodliest of all the Forest, Hart and Hind;
               Direct to the Eastern Gate was bent their flight.
               
                  Adam observed, and with his Eye the chase
               Pursuing, not unmoved to Eve thus spake.

               
            
            
               He erred not, for by this the heavenly Bands
               Down from a Sky of Jasper lighted now
               
               In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
               A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
               And carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye.
               Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
               
                  Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
               The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;
               Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeared
               In Dothan, covered with a Camp of Fire,
               Against the Syrian King, who to surprise
               One man, Assassin-like had levied War,
               War unproclam'd.  The Princely Hierarch
               In their bright stand, there left his Powers to seize
               Possession of the Garden; he alone,
               To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,
               Not unperceived of Adam, who to Eve,
               While the great Visitant approached, thus spake.

               
            
            
               He added not, for Adam at the news
               Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
               That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
               Yet all had heard, with audible lament
               Discovered soon the place of her retire.

               
            
            
               Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.
               
                  

               
            
            
               
                  Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
               Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,
               To Michael thus his humble words addressed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael with regard benign.
               
                  Adam, thou know Heaven his, and all the Earth. 
               Not this Rock only; his Omnipresence fills
               Land, Sea, and Air, and every kind that lives,
               Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
               All the Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
               No despicable gift; surmise not then
               His presence to these narrow bounds confined
               Of Paradise or Eden: this had been
               Perhaps thy Capital Seat, from whence had spread
               All generations, and had hither come
               From all the ends of the Earth, to celebrate
               
               And reverence thee their great Progenitor.
               But this pr??eminence thou has lost, brought down
               To dwell on even ground now with thy Sons:
               Yet doubt not but in Valley and in plain
               God is as here, and will be found alike
               Present, and of his presence many a sign
               Still following thee, still compassing thee round
               With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
               Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
               Which that thou may believe, and be confirmed
               Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
               To show thee what shall come in future days
               To thee and to thy Offspring; good with bad
               Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
               With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
               True patience, and to temper joy with fear
               And pious sorrow, equally inured
               By moderation either state to bear,
               Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
               Safest thy life, and best prepared endure
               Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend
               This Hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)
               Here sleep below while thou to foresight wake,
               As once thou sleeps, while She to life was formed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.
               
                  
 So both ascend
               In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
               Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
               The Hemisphere of Earth in clearest Ken
               
               Stretched out to the amplest reach
               Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
               Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
               Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
               To show him all Earths Kingdoms and their Glory.
               His Eye might there command wherever stood
               City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
               Of mightiest Empire, from the destined Walls
               Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can
               
               And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
               To Paquin of Sin??an Kings, and thence
               To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
               
               Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
               The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
               In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar
               
               In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,
               
                  Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
               Th'Empire of Negus to his utmost Port
               
                  Ercoco and the less Maritime Kings
               
                  Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
               And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realm
               Of Congo, and Angola farthest South;
               Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
               The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Suss,
               
                  Morocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
               On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
               The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
               Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
               And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
               Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoiled
               
                  Guiana, whose great City Geryons Sons
               Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights
               
                  Michael from Adams eyes the Film removed
               Which that false Fruit that promised clearer sight
               
               Had bred; then purged with Euphrasie and Rue
               The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
               And from the Well of Life three drops instilled.
               So deep the power of these Ingredients pierced,
               Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,
               That Adam now enforced to close his eyes,
               Sunk down and all his Spirits became entranced:
               But him the gentle Angel by the hand
               Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.

               
            
            
               His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,
               Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
               New reaped, the other part sheep-walks and folds;
               in the midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
               Rustic, of grassy sord; thither anon
               A sweaty Reaper from his Tillage brought
               First Fruits, the green Ear, and the yellow Sheaf,
               Uncalled, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
               More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
               Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
               The Inwards and their Fat, with Incense strewed,
               On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites performed.
               His Offering soon propitious Fire from Heaven
               Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;
               The others not, for his was not sincere;
               Whereat he inlie raged, and as they talked,
               Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
               That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
               Groaned out his Soul with gushing blood effus'd.
               
               Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
               Dismayed, and thus in haste to th'Angel cried.

               
            
            
               They whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.
               
                  
 To which
our Sire.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael.
                  
 Immediately a
place
               Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark,
               A Laser-house it seemed, wherein were laid
               Numbers of all diseased, all maladies
               Of ghastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualms
               
               Of heart-sick Agony, all feverous kinds,
               Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
               Intestine Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
               Daelig;monies Frenzy, moaping Melancholy
               And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophy,
               Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence,
               Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.
               Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
               Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
               And over them triumphant Death his Dart
               Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked
               With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.
               Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
               Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,
               Though not of Woman born; compassion quelled
               His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
               A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess,
               And scarce recovering words his plaint renewed.
 answered
Michael, 
 said Adam,
 said Michael,
 To whom our
Ancestor.

                  Michael replied.
               
            
            
               
                  

               
            
            
               He looked and saw a spacious Plain, whereon
               Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
               Of Cattle grazing: others, whence the sound
               Of Instruments that made melodious chime
               Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moved
               Their stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
               Instinct through all proportions low and high
               Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.
               In other part stood one who at the Forge
               Labouring, two massy clods of Iron and Brass     
               Had melted (whether found where casual fire
               Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
               Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
               To some Caves mouth, or whether washed by stream
               From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
               Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed
               First his own Tools; then, what might else be wrought
               Fusil or graven in mettle.  After these,
               But on the hither side a different sort
               From the high neighbouring Hills, which was their Seat,
               Down to the Plain descended: by their guise
               Just men they seemed, and all their study bent
               To worship God aright, and know his works
               Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve
               Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
               Long had not walked, when from the Tents behold
               A Heavy of fair Women, richly gay
               
               In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
               Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
               The Men though grave, eyed them, and let their eyes
               Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
               Fast caught, they liked, and each his liking chose;
               And now of love they treat till th'Eevning Star
               Loves Harbinger appeared; then all in heat
               They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
               
                  Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invoked;
               With Feast and Music all the Tents resound.
               Such happy interview and fair event
               Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
               And charming Symphonies attached the heart
               Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,
               The bent of Nature; which he thus expressed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.
               
                  
 Said th'Angel,

               
            
            
               He looked and saw wide Territory spread
               Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
               Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towers,
               Concourse in Arms, fierce Faces threatening War,
               Giants of mighty Bone, and bold empress;
               Part wield their Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
               Single or in Array of Battle ranged
               Both Horse and Foot, nor idly mustering stood;
               One way a Band select from forage drives
               A herd of Beeves, fair Oxen and fair Kine
               From a fat Meadow ground; or fleecy Flock,
               Ewes and their bleating Lambs over the Plain,
               Their Booty; scarce with Life the Shepherds fly,
                  
               
               But colin aide, which makes a bloody Fray;
               With cruel Tournament the Squadrons join;
               Where Cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
               With Carcasses and Arms th'ensanguind Field
               Deserted: Others to a City strong
               Lay Siege, encamped; by Battery, Scale, and Mine,
               Assaulting; others from the wall defend
               With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulphurous Fire;
               On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
               In other part the sceptred Heralds call
               To Council in the City Gates: anon
               Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriors mixed,
               Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
               In factious opposition, till at last
               Of middle Age one rising, eminent
               In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
               Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
               And Judgment from above: him old and young
               Exploded and had seized with violent hands,
               Had not a Cloud descending snatched him thence
               Unseen amid the throng: so violence
               Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
               Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
               
                  Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
               Lamenting turned full sad; O what are these,
               Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
               Inhumanly to men, and multiply
               Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew
               His Brother; for of whom such massacher
               Make they but of their Brethren, men of men?
               But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heaven
               Rescued, had in his Righteousness bin lost?

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael.

               
            
            
               He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed,
               The brazen Throat of War had ceased to roar,
               All now was turned to jollity and game,
               To luxury and riot, feast and dance,
               Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
               Rape or Adultery, where passing fair
               Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broils.
                  
               
               At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
               And of their doings great dislike declared,
               And testified against their ways; he oft
               Frequented their Assemblies, whereso met,
               Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preached
               Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
               In Prison under Judgements imminent:
               But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
               Contending, and removed his Tents far off;
               Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
               Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
               Measured by Cubit, length, and breadth, and height,
               Smeared round with Pitch, and in the side a door
               Contrived, and of provisions laid in large
               For Man and Beast: when lo a wonder strange1
               Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
               Came sevens, and pairs, and entered in, as taught
               Their order: last the Sire, and his three Sons
               With their four Wives; and God made fast the door.
               Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings
               Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
               From under Heaven; the Hills to their supply
               Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
               Sent up amain; and now the thickened Sky
               Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rushed the Rain
               Impetuous, and continued till the Earth
               No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
               Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
               Rode tilting o'er the Waves, all dwellings else
               Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
               Deep under water rolled; Sea covered Sea,
               Sea without shore; and in their Palaces
               Where luxury late reigned, Sea-monsters whelped
               And stabled; of Mankind, so numerous late,
               
               All left, in one small bottom swum embarked.
               How did thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
               The end of all thy Offspring, end so sad,
               Depopulation; thee another Flood,
               Of tears and sorrow a Flood thee also drowned,
               And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reared
               By th'Angel, on thy feet thou stood at last,
               Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
               His Children, all in view destroyed at once;
               And scarce to th'Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.
 To whom thus Michael.

               
            
            
               He looked, and saw the Ark hull on the flood,
               Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
               Driven by a keen North-winde, that blowing dry
               Wrinkled the face of Deluge, as decayed;
               And the clear Sun on his wide watery Glass
               Gazed hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
               As after thirst, which made their flowing shrink
               From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole
               With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopped
               His Sluices, as the Heaven his windows shut.
               The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
               Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
               And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appear;
               With clamour thence the rapid Currents drive
               Towards the retreating Sea their furious tide.
                  
               
               Forthwith from out the Arc a Raven flies,
               And after him, the surer messenger,
               A Dove sent forth once and again to spy
               Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
               The second time returning, in his Bill
               An Olive leaf he brings, pacific sign:
               Anon dry ground appears, and from his Arc
               The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
               Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
               Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds
               A dewy Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
               Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,
               Betok'ning peace from God, and Covenant new.
               Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
               Greatly rejoiced, and thus his joy broke forth.

               
            
            
               To whom the Archangel. 

            
               AS one who in his journey bates at Noon,
               Though bent on speed, so hear the Archangel paused
               Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,
               If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;
               Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes.

               
            
            
               Where to thus Adam fatherly displeased.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael. 

               
            
            
               Here Adam interposed. 

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael.

               
            
            
               He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy
               Surcharged, as had like grief bin dewed in tears,
               Without the vent of words, which these he breathed.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Michael.

               
            
            
               So spake the Archangel Michael, then  paused,
               As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
               Replete with joy and wonder thus replied.

              said th'Angel;

               
            
            
               He ended; and thus Adam last replied.
               
                  

               
            
            
               To whom thus also th'Angel last replied:
               
                  

               
            
            
               He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
               Descended, Adam to the Bower where Eve
               
               Lay sleeping ran before, but found her waked;
               And thus with words not sad she him received.

               
            
            
               So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard
               Well pleased, but answered not; for now too nigh
               
               the arch-angel stood, and from the other Hill
               To their fixed Station, all in bright array
               The Cherubim descended; on the ground
               Gliding meteor's, as Evening Mist
               Risen from a River o'er the marish glides,
               And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
               Homeward returning.  High in Front advanced,
               The brandished Sword of God before them blazed
               Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
               And vapour as the Lybian Air adust,
               Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
               In either hand the hastening Angel caught
               Our lingering Parents, and to the Eastern Gate
               Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
               To the subjected Plain; then disappeared.
               They looking back, all the Eastern side beheld
               Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
               Waved over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
               With dreadful Faces thronged and fiery Arms:
               Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;
               The World was all before them, where to choose
               Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:
               They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow,
               Through Eden took their solitary way.
               THE END.
