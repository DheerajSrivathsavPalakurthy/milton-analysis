 Deliverer from new Lords, leader
to free
               Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
               For Gods, and too unequal work we find
               Against unequal arms to fight in pain,
               Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil
               Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails
               Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain
               Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
               Of Mightiest.  Sense of pleasure we may well
               Spare out of life perhaps, and not rapine,
               But live content, which is the calmest life:
               But pain is perfect misery, the worst
               Of evils, and excessive, overturns
               All patience.  He who therefore can invent
               With what more forcible we may offend
               Our yet unwonted Enemies, or arm
               Our selves with like defence, to me deserves
               No less then for deliverance what we owe.
