               
            
            
               Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
               Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous, as thou see
               These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
               Though heaviest by just measure on thy self
               And thy adherents: how has thou disturb d
               Heavens blessed peace, and into Nature brought
               Misery, uncreated till the crime
               Of thy Rebellion? how has thou instilled
               Thy malice into thousands, once upright
               And faithful, now proved false.  But think not here
               
               To trouble Holy Rest; Heaven casts thee out
               From all her Confines.  Heaven the seat of bliss
               Brooks not the works of violence and War.
               Hence then, and evil go with thee along
               Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell,
               Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broils,
               Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doom,
               Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
               Precipitate thee with augmented pain.

               
            
            
               
                  Adam, Heavens high behest no Preface needs:
               Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
               Then due by sentence when thou did transgress,
               Defeated of his seizure many days
               Given thee of Grace, wherein thou may repent,
               And one bad act with many deeds well done
               May cover: well may then thy Lord appeased
               Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claim;
               But longer in this Paradise to dwell
               Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
               And send thee from the Garden forth to till
               The ground whence thou was taken, fitter Soil.
               
                  
 Lament not Eve, but
patiently resign
               What justly thou has lost; nor set thy heart,
               Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine;
               Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
               Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
               Where he abides, think there thy native soil.

               
            
            
               
                  Adam, now open thine eyes, and first behold
               Th'effects which thy original crime hath wrought
               In some to spring from thee, who never touched
               Th'excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspired,
               Nor sinned thy sin, yet from that derive
               Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.
 These two are Brethren, Adam,
and to come
               Out of thy loins; th'unjust the just hath slain,
               For envy that his Brothers Offering found
               From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody Fact
               Will be avenged, and th'others Faith approved
               Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
               Rolling in dust and gore. 

 Death thou has seen
               In his first shape on man; but many shapes
               Of Death, and many are the ways that lead
               To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
               More terrible at th'entrance then within.
               Some, as thou saw, by violent stroke shall die,
               By Fire, Flood, Famine, by Intemperance more
               In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring
               Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
               Before thee shall appear; that thou may know
               What misery th'inabstinence of Eve
               
               Shall bring on men.  

               
            
            
               Their Makers Image, 
 then
               Forsook them, when themselves they vilified
               To serve ungoverned appetite, and took
               His Image whom they served, a brutish vice,
               Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
               Therefore so abject is their punishment,
               Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but their own,
               Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced
               While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
               To loathsome sickness, worthily, since they
               Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

               
            
            
               There is, 

 if thou well observe
               The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
               In what thou eats and drinks, seeking from thence
               Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
               Till many years over thy head return:
               So may thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
               Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
               Gathered, not harshly plucked, for death mature:
               This is old age; but then thou must outlive
               Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
               To withered weak and gray; thy Senses then
               Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgo,
               To what thou has, and for the Air of youth
               Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign
               A melancholy damp of cold and dry
               To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume
               The Balm of Life. 
 Nor love thy Life, nor hate;
but what thou  lives
               Live well, how long or short permit to Heaven:
               And now prepare thee for another sight.

 Judge not what is best
               By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
               Created, as thou art, to nobler end
               Holy and pure, conformity divine.
               Those Tents thou saw so pleasant, were the Tents
               Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
               Who slew his Brother; studious they appear
               Of Arts that polish Life, Inventors rare,
               Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit
               Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledged none.
               Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;
               For that fair female Troop thou saw, that seemed
               Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
               Yet empty of all good wherein consists
               
               Women's domestic honour and chief praise;
               Bred only and completed to the taste
               Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
               To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roll the Eye.
               To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
               Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,
               Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame
               Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
               Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
               (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which
               The world erelong a world of tears must weep.
 From Mans effeminate
slackness it begins,
               
                  

 who should better hold  his place
               By wisdom, and superior gifts received.
               But now prepare thee for another Scene.

 These are the product
               Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw;
               
               Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves
               Abhor to join; and by imprudence mixed,
               Produce prodigious Births of body or mind.
               Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
               For in those days Might only shall be admired,
               And Valour and Heroic Virtue called;
               To overcome in Battle, and subdue
               Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
               Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
               Of human Glory, and for Glory done
               Of triumph, to be styled great Conquerors,
               Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
               Destroyers rightlier called and Plagues of men.
               Thus Fame shall be achieved, renown on Earth,
               And what most merits fame in silence hid.
               But he the seventh from thee, whom thou behold
               The only righteous in a World perverse,
               And therefore hated, therefore so beset
               With Foes for daring single to be just,
               And utter odious Truth, that God would come
               To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
               Rapt in a balmy Cloud with winged Steeds
               Did, as thou saw, receive, to walk with God
               High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
               Exempt from Death; to show thee what reward
               Awaits the good, the rest what punishment?
               Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.

 Those whom last thou saw
               In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
               First seen in acts of prowess eminent
               And great exploits, but of true virtue void;
               Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
               Subduing Nations, and achieved thereby
               Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
               Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
               Surfeit, and lust, till wantonness and pride
               Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in Peace.
               The conquered also, and enslaved by War
               Shall with their freedom lost all virtue loose
               And fear of God, from whom their piety feigned
               In sharp contest of Battle found no aide
               Against invaders; therefore cooled in zeal
               Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
               Worldly or dissolute, on what their Lords
               Shall leave them to enjoy; for the Earth shall bear
               More then enough, that temperance may be tried:
               So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved,
               Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
               One Man except, the only Son of light
               In a dark Age, against example good,
               Against allurements, custom, and a World
               Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
               Or violence, he of their wicked ways
               Shall them admonish, and before them set
               The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
               And full of peace, denouncing wrath to come
               On their impenitence; and shall return
               Of them derided, but of God observed
               The one just Man alive; by his command
               Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou behold,
               To save himself and household from amidst
               
               A World devote to universal rack.
               No sooner he with them of Man and Beast
               Select for life shall in the Ark be lodged,
               And sheltered round, but all the Cataracts
               Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall power
               Rain day and night, all fountains of the Deep
               Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
               Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
               Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
               Of Paradise by might of Waves be moved
               Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,
               With all his verdure spoiled, and Trees adrift
               Down the great River to the opening Gulf,
               And there take root an Island salt and bare,
               The haunt of Seals and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
               To teach thee that God attributes to place
               No sanctity, if none be thither brought
               By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
               And now what further shall ensue, behold.

Dexterously thou aim;
               So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
               Though late repenting him of Man depraved,
               Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw
               The whole Earth filled with violence, and all flesh
               
               Corrupting each their way; yet those removed,
               Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
               That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
               And makes a Covenant never to destroy
               The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
               Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
               With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
               Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
               His triple-coloured Bow, whereon to look
               And call to mind his Covenant: Day and Night,
               Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
               Shall hold their course, till fire purge all things new,
               Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
               The End of the Eleventh Book.
            
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. BOOK XII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            The Angel Michael continues from the Flood to relate
what  shall succeed; then, in the mention of Abraham, comes by
 degrees to explain, who that Seed of the Woman shall be, which  was
promised Adam and Eve in the Fall; his Incarnation, 
Death, Resurrection, and Ascention; the state of the Church till  his
second Coming. Adam greatly satisfied and recomfort by 
these Relations and Promises descends the Hill with 
Michael; wakens Eve, who all this while had slept,
but with  gentle dreams composed to quietness of mind and submission. 
Michael in either hand leads them out of                                
     
Paradise, the fiery Sword waving behind  them, and
the Cherubim taking their Stations to guard the  Place,
            
            

               
            
            
               Thus thou has seen one World begin and end;
               And Man as from a second stock proceed.
               Much thou has yet to see, but I perceive
               Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine
               Must needs impair and weary human sense:
               Henceforth what is to come I will relate,
               Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
               This second sours of Men, while yet but few;
               And while the dread of judgement past remains
               Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,
               With some regard to what is just and right
               Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace,
               Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,
               Corn wine and oil; and from the herd or flock,
               Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
               With large Wine-offerings poured, and sacred Feast,
               Shall spend their days in joy unblamed, and dwell
               Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
               Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
               Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
               With fair equality, fraternal state,
               Will arrogate Dominion undeserved
               Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
               Concord and law of Nature from the Earth,
               Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
               With War and hostile snare such as refuse
               
               Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
               A mighty Hunter thence he shall be styled
               Before the Lord, as in despite of Heaven,
               Or from Heaven climbing second Sovereignty;
               And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
               Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
               He with a crew, whom like Ambition joins
               With him or under him to tyrannise,
               Marching from Eden towards the West, shall find
               The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
               Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
               Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
               A City and Tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;
               And get themselves a name, least far dispersed
               In foreign Lands their memory be lost
               Regardless whether good or evil fame.
               But God who oft descends to visit men
               Unseen, and through their habitations walks
               To mark their doings, them beholding soon,
               Comes down to see their City, ere the Tower
               Obstruct Heaven Towers, and in derision sets
               Upon their Tongues a various Spirit to raise
               Quite out their Native Language, and instead
               To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
               Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
               Among the Builders; each to other calls
               Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
               As mocked they storm; great laughter was in Heaven
               And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
               And hear the din; thus was the building left
               Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
               
                  

 Justly thou abhorr'st
               That Son, who on the quiet state of men
               Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
               Rational Liberty; yet know withal,
               Since thy original lapse, true Liberty
               Is lost, which always with right Reason dwells
               Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:
               Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,
               Immediately inordinate desires
               And upstart Passions catch the Government
               From Reason, and to servitude reduce
               Man till then free.  Therefore since he permits
               Within himself unworthy Powers to reign
               Over free Reason, God in judgement just
               Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
               Who oft as undeservedly enthral
               His outward freedom: Tyranny must be,
               Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
               Yet sometimes Nations will decline so low
               
               From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,
               But Justice, and some fatal curse annexed
               Deprives them of their outward liberty,
               Their inward lost: Witness th'irreverent Son
               Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
               Don to his Father, heard this heavy curse,
               
                  

 Doubt  not but that sin
               Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
               And therefore was Law given them to evince
               Their natural pravitie, by stirring up
               Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
               Law can discover sin, but not remove,
               Save by those shadowy expiations weak,
               The blood of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
               Some blood more precious must be paid for Man,
               Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
               To them by Faith imputed, they may find
                  
               
               Justification towards God, and peace
               Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
               Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
               Perform, and not performing cannot live.
               So law appears imperfect, and but given
               With purpose to resign them in full time
               Up to a better Covenant, disciplined
               From shadowy Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
               From imposition of strict Laws, to free
               Acceptance of large Grace, from servile fear
               To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
               And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
               Highly beloved, being but the Minister
               Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;
               But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
               His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
               The adversary Serpent, and bring back
               Through the worlds wilderness long wandered man
               Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
               Meanwhile they in their earthly Canaan placed
               Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
               National interrupt their public peace,
               Provoking God to raise them enemies:
               From whom as oft he saves them penitent
               By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
               The second, both for piety renowned
               And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
               Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
               For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
               All Prophecy, That of the Royal Stock
               Of David (so I name this King) shall rise
               A Son, the Women's Seed to thee foretold,
               Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
               
               All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
               The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
               But first a long succession must ensue,
               And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom famed,
               The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
               Wandering, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
               Such follow him, as shall be registered
               Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scroll,
               Whose foul Idolatrous, and other faults
               Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense
               God, as to leave them, and expose their Land,
               Their City, his Temple, and his holy Ark
               With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
               To that proud City, whose high Walls thou saw
               Left in confusion, Babylon thence called.
               There in captivity he lets them dwell
               The space of seventy years, then brings them back,
               Remembering mercy, and his Covenant sworn
               To David, stablisht as the days of Heaven.
               Returned from Babylon by leave of Kings
               Their Lords, whom God disposed, the house of God
               They first re-edifie, and for a while
               In mean estate live moderate, till grown
               In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
               But first among the Priests dissension springs,
               Men who attend the Altar, and should most
               Endeavour Peace: their strife pollution brings
               Upon the Temple it self: at last they seize
               The Sceptre, and regard not Davits Sons,
               Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
               Anointed King Messiah might be born
               Barred of his right; yet at his Birth a Star
               Unseen before in Heaven proclaims him come,
                  
               
               And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
               His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
               His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
               To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
               They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
               Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
               A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
               The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
               The Throne hereditary, and bound his Reign
               With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.
               
                  

 Dream  not of their fight,
               As of a Duel, or the local wounds
               Of head or heel: not therefore joins the Son
               Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
               Thy enemy; nor so is overcome
               
                  Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,
               Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound:
               Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recur,
               Not by destroying Satan, but his works
               
               In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
               But by fulfilling that which thou did want,
               Obedience to the Law of God, imposed
               On penalty of death, and suffering death,
               The penalty to thy transgression due,
               And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
               So only can high Justice rest appaid.
               The Law of God exact he shall fulfil
               Both by obedience and by love, though love
               Alone fulfil the Law; thy punishment
               He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
               To a reproachful life and cursed death,
               Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
               In his redemption, and that his obedience
               Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
               To save them, not their own, though legal works.
               For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,
               Seized on by force, judged, and to death condemned
               A shameful and accursed, nailed to the Cross
               By his own Nation, slain for bringing Life;
               But to the Cross he nails thy Enemies,
               The Law that is against thee, and the sins
               Of all mankind, with him there crucified,
               Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
               In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
               But soon revives, Death over him no power
               Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
               Return, the Stars of Morn shall see him rise
               Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
               Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
               His death for Man, as many as offered Life
               Neglect not, and the benefit embrace
               By Faith not void of works: this God-like act
                  
               
               Annuls thy doom, the death thou should have died,
               In sin for ever lost from life; this act
               Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength
               Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine arms,
               And fix far deeper in his head their stings
               Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
               Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
               A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
               Nor after resurrection shall he stay
               Longer on Earth then certain times to appear
               To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
               Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge
               To teach all nations what of him they learned
               And his Salvation, them who shall believe
               Baptising in the profluent stream, the sign
               Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
               Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
               For death, like that which the redeemer died.
               All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
               Not only to the Sons of Abrahams Loins
               Salvation shall be Preached, but to the Sons
               Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;
               So in his seed all Nations shall be blessed.
               Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
               With victory, triumphing through the air
               Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
               The Serpent, Prince of air, and drag in Chains
               Through all his Realm, and there confounded leave;
               Then enter into glory, and resume
               His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
               Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,
               When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
               With glory and power to judge both quick and dead,
               
               To judge th'unfaithful dead, but to reward
               His faithful, and receive them into bliss,
               Whether in Heaven or Earth, for then the Earth
               Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
               Then this of Eden, and far happier days.

               
            
            
               Be sure they will, 
 but
              from Heaven
               He to his own a Comforter will send,
               The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
               His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
               Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,
               To guide them in all truth, and also arm
               With spiritual Armour, able to resist
               
                  Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts,
               What man can do against them, not afraid,
               
               Though to the death, against such cruelties
               With inward consolations recompense,
               And oft supported so as shall amaze
               Their proudest persecutors: for the Spirit
               Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends
               To evangelise the Nations, then on all
               Baptised, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
               To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
               As did their Lord before them.  Thus they win
               Great numbers of each Nation to receive
               With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: at length
               Their Ministry performed, and race well run,
               Their doctrine and their story written left,
               They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,
               Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
               Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
               To their own vile advantages shall turn
               Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
               With superstitions and traditions taint,
               Left only in those written Records pure,
               Though not but by the Spirit understood.
               Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
               Places and titles, and with these to join
               Secular power, though feigning still to act
               By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
               The Spirit of God, promised alike and given
               To all Believers; and from that pretence,
               Spiritual Laws by carnal power shall force
               On every conscience; Laws which none shall find
               Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
               Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
               But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and bind
               His consort Liberty; what, but unbuild
               
               His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
               Their own Faith not another: for on Earth
               Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
               Infallible? yet many will presume:
               Whence heavy persecution shall arise
               On all who in the worship persevere
               Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part,
               Will deem in outward Rites and specious forms
               Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire
               Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of Faith
               Rarely be found: so shall the World go on,
               To good malignant, to bad men benign,
               Under her own weight groaning till the day
               Appear of respiration to the just,
               And vengeance to the wicked, at return
               Of him so lately promised to thy aid
               The Women's seed, obscurely then foretold,
               Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
               Last in the Clouds from Heaven to be reveled
               In glory of the Father, to dissolve
               
                  Satan with his perverted World, then raise
               From the conflagrations mass, purged and refined,
               New Heavens, new Earth, Ages of endless date
               Founded in righteousness and peace and love
               To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.
 This having learnt, thou has
attained the sum
               Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Stars
               Thou knew by name, and all the Ethereal Powers,
               All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
               Or works of God in Heaven, Air, Earth, or Sea,
               And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
               And all the rule, one Empire; only add
               Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
               Add virtue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
               By name to come called Charity, the soul
               Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
               To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
               A paradise within thee, happier far.
               Let us descend now therefore from this top
               Of Speculation; for the hour precise
               Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
               By me encamped on yonder Hill, expect
               Their motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
               
               In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
               We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
               Her also I with gentle Dreams have calmed
               Portending good, and all her spirits composed
               To meek submission: thou at season fit
               Let her with thee partake what thou has heard,
               Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
               The great deliverance by her Seed to come
               (For by the Women's Seed) on all Mankind.
               That ye may live, which will be many days,
               Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
               With cause for evils past, yet much more cheered
               With meditation on the happy end.
