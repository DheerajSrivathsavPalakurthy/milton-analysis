 Open, ye everlasting Gates,
 Open, ye Heavens, your living
doors; let in
               The great Creator from his work returned
               Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;
               Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
               To visit oft the dwellings of just Men
               Delighted, and with frequent intercourse
               Thither will send his winged Messengers
               On errands of supernal Grace.  
 Great are thy works, Jehovah,
infinite
               Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue
               Relate thee; greater now in thy return
               Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day
               Thy Thunders magnified; but to create
               Is greater then created to destroy.
               Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound
               Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt
               Of Spirits apostate and their Counsels vain
               Thou has repealed, while impiously they thought
               Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
               The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks
               To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
               To manifest the more thy might: his evil
               Thou use, and from thence creates more good.
               Witness this new-made World, another Heaven
               From Heaven Gate not far, founded in view
               On the clear Hyaline, the Glassy Sea;
               Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's
               
               Numerous, and every Star perhaps a World
               Of destined habitation; but thou know
               Their seasons: among these the seat of men,
               Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,
               Their pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happy men,
               And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanced,
               Created in his Image, there to dwell
               And worship him, and in reward to rule
               Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,
               And multiply a Race of Worshippers
               Holy and just: thrice happy if they know
               Their happiness, and persevere upright.
               
                  

Just are thy  ways,
               Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;
               Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,
               Destined restorer of Mankind, by whom
               New Heaven and Earth shall to the Ages rise,
               Or down from Heaven descend.
