                  Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such
               Created, or such place has here to dwell,
               As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven
               To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bower
               Over-shades; for these mid-hours, till Evening rise
               I have at will. 

               
            
            
               Hail Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb
               Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons
               Then with these various fruits the Trees of God
               Have heaped this Table. 
 Therefore
 what he gives
               (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part
               Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
               No ungrateful food; and food alike those pure
               Intelligential substances require
               As doth your Rational; and both contain
               Within them every lower faculty
               Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
               Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
               And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
               For know, whatever was created, needs
               To be sustained and fed; of Elements
               The grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,
               Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires
               Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;
               Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged
               Vapours not yet into her substance turned.
               Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale
               From her moist Continent to higher Orbs.
               The Sun that light imparts to all, receives
               From all his elemental recompense
               In humid exhalations, and at Even
               Sups with the Ocean: though in Heaven the Trees
               Of life ambrosial fruit bear, and vines
               Yield Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn
               We brush mellifluous Dews, and find the ground
               Covered with pearly grain: yet God hath here
               Varied his bounty so with new delights,
               As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
               Think not I shall be nice. 
 O Adam, one Almighty
is, from whom
               All things proceed, and up to him return,
               If not depraved from good, created all 
                  
               
               Such to perfection, one first matter all,
               Endued with various forms various degrees
               Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
               But more refined, more spirituous, and pure,
               As nearer to him placed or nearer tending
               Each in their several active Spears assigned,
               Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
               Proportion to each kind. So from the root
               Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
               More aerie, last the bright consummate flower
               Spirits odorous breathes: flours and their fruit
               Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed
               To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,
               To intellectual, give both life and sense,
               Fancy and understanding, whence the Soul
               Reason receives, and reason is her being,
               Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse
               Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
               Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
               Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
               If I refuse not, but convert, as you,
               To proper substance; time may come when men
               With Angels may participate, and find
               No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:
               And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
               Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit,
               Improved by tract of time, and winged ascend
               Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice
               Here or in Heavenly Paradises dwell;
               If ye be found obedient, and retain
               Unalterably firm his love entire
               Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy
               Your fill what happiness this happy state
               Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
                  
 Son of
Heaven and  Earth,
               Attend: That thou are happy, owe to God;
               That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,
               That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
               This was that caution given thee; be advised.
               God made thee perfect, not immutable;
               And good he made thee, but to persevere
               He left it in thy power, ordained thy will
               By nature free, not over-ruled by Fate
               Inextricable, or strict necessity;
               Our voluntary service he requires,
               Not our necessitated, such with him
               Finds no acceptance, nor can find, for how
               Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
               Willing or no, who will but what they must
               By Destiny, and can no other choose?
               My self and all the Angelic Host that stand
               In sight of God enthroned, our happy state
               Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
               On other surety none; freely we serve,
               Because wee freely love, as in our will 
                  
               
               To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
               And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,
               And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall
               From what high state of bliss into what woe!

               
            
            
               High matter thou enjoin me, O prime of men,
               Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate
               To human sense the invisible exploits
               Of warring Spirits; how without remorse
               The ruin of so many glorious once
               And perfect while they stood; how last unfold
               The secrets of another world, perhaps
               Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
               This is dispensed, and what surmounts the reach
               Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
               By likening spiritual to corporal forms, 
               
               As may express them best, though what if Earth
               Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein
               Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?
            
            
               As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde
               Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests
               Upon her Center poised, when on a day
               (For Time, though in Eternity, applied
               To motion, measures all things durable
               By present, past, and future) on such day
               As Heavens great Year brings forth, the Empyreal Host
               Of Angels by Imperial summons called,
               Innumerable before the almighty's Throne
               Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared
               Under their Hierarchs in orders bright
               Ten thousand thousand Ensigns high advanced,
               Standards, and Gonfalons between Van and Rear
               Stream in the Air, and for distinction serve
               Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;
               Or in their glittering Tissues bear emblazed
               Holy Memorials, acts of Zeal and Love
               Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbs
               Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
               Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,
               By whom in bliss bosomed sat the Son,
               Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top
               Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.

            
               ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursued
               Through Heavens wide Champagne held his way, till Morn,
               Waked by the circling Hours, with rosie hand
               Unbarred the gates of Light.  There is a Cave
               Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,
               Where light and darkness in perpetual round
               Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
               Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;
               Light issues forth, and at the other door
               Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
               To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
               Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn
               Such as in highest Heaven, arrayed in Gold
               Imperial, from before her vanished Night,
               Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain
               Coverd with thick embattled Squadrons bright,
               Chariots and flaming Arms, and fiery Steeds
               Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
               War he perceived, war in procinct, and found
               Already known what he for news had thought
               To have reported: gladly then he mixed
               Among those friendly Powers who him received
               With joy and acclamation loud, that one
               That of so many Myriads fallen, yet one
               Returned not lost: On to the sacred hill
               They led him high applauded, and present
               Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice
               From midst a Golden Cloud thus mild was heard.

               
            
            
               So spake the Soverign voice, and Clouds began
               To darken all the Hill, and smoke to roll
               In dusky wreathes, reluctant flames, the sign
               Of wrath awaked: nor with less dread the loud
               Ethereal Trumpet from on high began blow:
               At which command the Powers Militant,
               That stood for Heaven, in mighty Quadrate join"d
               Of Union irresistible, moved on
               In silence their bright Legions, to the sound
               Of instrumental Harmony that breathed
               Heroic Ardor to adventurous deeds
               Under their God-like Leaders, in the Cause
               
               Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
               Indissoluble firm; nor obvious Hill,
               Nor straitening Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides
               Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
               Their march was, and the passive Air upbore
               Their nimble tread, as when the total kind
               Of Birds in orderly array on wing
               Came summoned over Eden to receive
               Their names of thee; so over many a tract
               Of Heaven they marched, and many a Province wide
               Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last
               Far in the Horizon to the North appeared
               From skirt to skirt a fiery Region, stretched
               In battailous aspect, and nearer view
               Bristled with upright beams innumerable
               Of rigid Spears, and Helmets thronged, and Shields
               Various, with boastful Argument portrait,
               The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
               With furious expedition; for they weend
               That self same day by fight, or by surprise
               To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne
               To set the envier of his State, the proud
               Aspirer, but their thoughts proved fond and vain
               In the mid way: though strange to us it seemed
               At first, that Angel should with Angel war,
               And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
               So oft in Festivals of joy and love
               Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire
               Hymning the Eternal Father: but the shout
               Of Battle now began, and rushing sound
               Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
               High in the midst exalted as a God
               the apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sate
               Idol of Majesty Divine, enclosed 
                  
               
               With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;
               Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now
               Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,
               A dreadful interval, and Front to Front
               Presented stood in terrible array
               Of hideous length: before the cloudy Van,
               On the rough edge of battle ere it join,d,
               
                  Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced,
               Came towering, armed in Adamant and Gold;
               
                  Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
               Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
               And thus his own undaunted heart explores.

               
            
            
               So pondering, and from his armed Peers
               Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
               His daring foe, at this prevention more
               Incensed, and thus securely him defied.

               
            
            
               Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
               Thus answered. 

               
            
            
               To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.
               
                  
 So saying, a noble stroke he
lifted high,
               Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
               On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight,
               Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield
               Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge
               He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
               His massy Spear upstaid; as if on Earth
               Winds under ground or waters forcing way
               Sidelong, had pushed a Mountain from his seat
               Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seized
               The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see
               Thus foiled their mightiest, ours joy filled, and shout,
               Presage of Victory and fierce desire
               Of Battle: whereat Michael bid sound
               The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
               
               It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung
               
                  Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze
               The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joined
               The horrid shock: now storming fury rose,
               And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
               Was never, Arms on Armour clashing brayed
               Horrible discord, and the matting Wheels
               Of brazen Chariots raged; dire was the noise
               Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
               Of fiery Darts in flaming voles flew,
               And flying vaulted either Host with fire.
               So under fiery Cope together rushed
               Both Battles maine, with ruinous assault
               And inextinguishable rage; all Heaven
               Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth
               Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when
               Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
               On either side, the least of whom could wield
               These Elements, and arm him with the force
               Of all their Regions: how much more of Power
               Army against Army numberless to raise
               Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
               Though not destroy, their happy Native seat;
               Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
               From his strong hold of Heaven high over-ruled
               And limited their might; though numbered such
               As each divided Legion might have seemed
               A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand
               A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemed
               Each Warrior single as in Chief, expert
               When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
               Of Battle, open when, and when to close
               The ridges of grim War; no thought of flight,
               None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
               
               That argued fear; each on himself relied,
               As only in his arm the moment lay
               Of victory; deeds of eternal fame
               Were don, but infinite: for wide was spread
               That War and various; sometimes on firm ground
               A standing fight, then soaring on main wing
               Tormented all the Air; all Air seemed then
               Conflicting Fire: long time in even scale
               The Battle hung; till Satan, who that day
               Prodigious power had shown, and met in Arms
               No equal, ranging through the dire attack
               Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
               Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and felled
               Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway
               Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
               Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
               He hasted, and opposed the rocky Orb
               Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield
               A vast circumference: At his approach
               The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
               Surceased, and glad as hoping here to end
               Intestine War in Heaven, the arch foe subdued
               Or Captive dragged in Chains, with hostile frown
               And visage all inflamed first thus began.

               
            
            
               So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
               The Adversary. 

               
            
            
               They ended parley, and both addressed for fight
               Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
               Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
               Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift
               Human imagination to such height
               Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemed,
               Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms
               Fit to decide the Empire of great Heaven.
               Now waved their fiery Swords, and in the Air
               Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns their Shields
               
               Blazed opposite, while expectation stood
               In horror; from each hand with speed retired
               Where erst was thickest fight, the Angelic throng,
               And left large field, unsafe within the wind
               Of such commotion, such as to set forth
               Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,
               Among the Constellations war were sprung,
               Two Planets rushing from aspect malign
               Of fiercest opposition in mid Sky,
               Should combat, and their jarring Spears confound.
               Together both with next to Almighty Arm,
               Uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed
               That might determine, and not need repeat,
               As not of power, at once; nor odds appeared
               In might or swift prevention; but the sword
               Of Michael from the Armoury of God
               Was given him tempered so, that neither keen
               Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
               The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
               Descending, and in half cut sheer, nor staid,
               But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering shared
               All his right side; then Satan first knew pain,
               And writhed him to and fro convolv'd; so sore
               The griding sword with discontinuous wound
               Passed through him, but the Ethereal substance closed
               Not long divisible, and from the gash
               A stream of Nectarous humour issuing flowed
               Sanguine, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,
               And all his Armour stained ere while so bright.
               Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run
               By Angels many and strong, who interposed
               Defence, while others bore him on their Shields
               Back to his Chariot; where it stood retired
               From off the files of war; there they him laid
               
               Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
               To find himself not matchless, and his pride
               Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath
               His confidence to equal God in power.
               Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout
               Vital in every part, not as frail man
               In Entrails, Heart or Head, Liver or Reins;
               Cannot but by annihilating die;
               Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
               Receive, no more then can the fluid Air:
               All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Ear,
               All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,
               They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size
               Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.
            
            
               Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
               Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
               And with fierce Ensigns pierced the deep array
               Of Moloc furious King, who him defied,
               And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound
               Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
               Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
               Down cloven to the waste, with shattered Arms
               And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing
               
                  Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,
               Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armed,
               Vanquished Adramelec, and Asmadai,
               Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods
               Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
               Mangled with ghastly wounds through Plate and Mail,
               Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
               The Atheist crew, but with redoubled blow
               
                  Ariel and Arioc, and the violence
               Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew.
               I might relate of thousands, and their names
               
               Eternize here on Earth; but those elect
               Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
               Seek not the praise of men: the other sort
               In might though wondrous and in Acts of War,
               Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doom
               Concealed from Heaven and sacred memory,
               Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
               For strength from Truth divided and from Just,
               Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
               And ignominy, yet to glory aspires
               Vain glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
               Therefore Eternal silence be their doom.
            
            
               And now their Mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
               With many an inrode gored; deformed rout
               Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
               With shiverd armour strewn, and on a heap
               Chariot and Charioteer lay overturn
               And fiery foaming Steeds; what stood, recoiled
               Overwearied, through the faint Satanic Host
               Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
               Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
               Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
               By sin of disobedience, till that hour
               Not liable to fear or flight or pain.
               Far otherwise th'inviolable Saints
               In Cubic Phalanx firm advanced entire,
               Invulnerable, impenetrably armed:
               Such high advantages their innocence
               Gave them above their foes, not to have send,
               Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
               Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
               By wound, though from their place by violence moved.
            
            
               Now Night her course began, and over Heaven
               Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,
               
               And silence on the odious din of War:
               Under her Cloudy covert both retired,
               Victor and Vanquished: on the foughten field
               
                  Michael and his Angels prevalent
               Encamping, placed in Guard their Watches round,
               Cherubic waving fires: on the other part
               
                  Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
               Far in the dark dislodged, and void of rest,
               His Potentates to Council called by night;
               And in the midst thus undismayed began.

               
            
            
               He sat; and in The Assembly next upstood
               
                  Nisroc, of Principalities the prime;
               As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,
               Sore toiled, his riven Arms to havoc hewn,
               And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.
               
                  

               
            
            
               Where to with look composed Satan  replied.
 He ended, and his words their
drooping chere
               Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
               Th'invention all admired, and each, how he
               To be th'inventer missed, so easy it seemed
               Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
               Impossible: yet happily of thy Race
               In future days, if Malice should abound,
               Some one intent on mischief, or inspired
               With devilish machination might devise
               Like instrument to plague the Sons of men
               For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
               Forthwith from Council to the work they flew,
               None arguing stood, innumerable hands
               Were ready, in a moment up they turned
                  
               
               Wide the Celestial soil, and saw beneath
               Th'originals of Nature in their crude
               Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foam
               They found, they mingled, and with subtle Art,
               Concocted and adusted they reduced
               To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
               Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this Earth
               Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,
               Whereof to found their Engines and their Balls
               Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
               Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
               So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night
               Secret they finished, and in order set,
               With silent circumspection unespied.
               Now when fair Morn Orient in Heaven appeared
               Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms
               The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood
               Of Golden Panoply, refulgent Host,
               Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills
               Looked round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scour,
               Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,
               Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
               In motion or in alt: him soon they met
               Under spread Ensigns moving nigh, in slow
               But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail
               
                  Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
               Came flying, and in mid Air aloud thus cried.
 So warned he them aware
themselves, and soon
               In order, quit of all impediment;
               Instant without disturb they took Alarm,
               And onward move Embattled; when behold
               Not distant far with heavy pace the Foe
               Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube
               Training his devilish Enginrie, impaled
               On every side with shadowing Squadrons Deep,
               To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
               A while, but suddenly at head appeared
               
                  Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud.

               
            
            
               So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce,
               Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front
               Divided, and to either Flank retired.
               Which to our eyes discovered new and strange,
               A triple mounted row of Pillars laid
               On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seemed
               Or hollowed bodies made of Oak or Fur
               With branches lopped, in Wood or Mountain felled)
               Brass, Iron, Stony mould, had not their mouths
               With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,
                  
               
               Portending hollow truce; at each behind
               A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed
               Stood waving tipped with fire; while we suspense,
               Collected stood within our thoughts amused,
               Not long, for sudden all at once their Reeds
               Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied
               With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
               But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,
               From those deep throated Engines belched, whose roar
               Emboweld with outrageous noise the Air,
               And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
               Their devilish glut, chained Thunderbolts and Hail
               Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host
               Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
               That whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
               Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell
               By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;
               The sooner for their Arms, unarmed they might
               Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
               By quick contraction or remove; but now
               Foul dissipation followed and forced rout;
               Nor served it to relax their serried files.
               What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
               Repeated, and indecent overthrow
               Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
               And to their foes a laughter; for in view
               Stood ranked of Seraphim another row
               In posture to displode their second tire
               Of Thunder: back defeated to return
               They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,
               And to his Mates thus in derision ca11'd.

               
            
            
               To whom thus Belial in like gamesom  mood,
               
                  

               
            
            
               So they among themselves in pleasant vein
               Stood scoffing, heightened in their thoughts beyond
               All doubt of Victory, eternal might
               To match with their inventions they presumed
               So easy, and of his Thunder made a scorn,
               And all his Host derided, while they stood
               A while in trouble; but they stood not long,
               Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
               Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
               Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
               Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed)
               Their Arms away they threw, and to the Hills
               (For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
               Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)
               Light as the Lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,
               From their foundations loosening to and fro
               They plucked the seated Hills with all their load,
               Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggy tops 
                  
               
               Up lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,
               Be sure, and terror seized the rebel Host,
               When coming towards them so dread they saw
               The bottom of the Mountains upward turned,
               Till on those cursed Engines triple-row
               They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
               Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,
               Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
               Main Promontories flung, which in the Air
               Came shadowing, and oppressed whole Legions armed,
               Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
               Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
               Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,
               Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
               Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
               Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
               The rest in imitation to like Arms
               Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;
               So Hills amid the Air encountered Hills
               Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
               That under ground, they fought in dismal shade;
               Infernal noise; War seemed a civil Game
               To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
               Upon confusion rose: and now all Heaven
               Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspread,
               Had not the almighty Father where he sits
               shrined in his Sanctuary of Heaven secure,
               Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
               This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
               That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
               To honour his Anointed Son avenged
               Upon his enemies, and to declare
               All power on him transferred: whence to his Son
               Th'Assessor of his Throne he thus began.
               
               
                  

               
            
            
               He said, and on his Son with Rays direct
               Shone full, he all his Father full expressed
               Ineffably into his face received,
               And thus the filial Godhood answering spake.

               
            
            
               So spake the Son, and into terror changed
               His countenance too severe to be beheld
               And full of wrath bent on his Enemies.
               At once the Four spread out their Starry wings
               With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbs
               Of his fierce Chariot rolled, as with the sound
               Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.
               He on his impious Foes right onward drove,
               Gloomy as Night; under his burning Wheels
               The steadfast Empyrean shook throughout,
               All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon
               Among them he arrived; in his right hand
               Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent
               Before him, such as in their Souls infixed
               Plagues; they astonished all resistance lost,
               All courage; down their idle weapons dropped;
               O'er Shields and Helmes, and helmet heads he rode
               Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
               That wished the Mountains now might be again
               Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.
               Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
               His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Four,
               Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels
               Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,
               One Spirit in them ruled, and every eye
               Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
               
               Among th'accurst, that withered all their strength,
               And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
               Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
               Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
               His Thunder in mid Volly, for he meant
               Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:
               The overthrown he raised, and as a Heard
               Of Goats or timorous flock together thronged
               Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursued
               With terrors and with furies to the bounds
               And Crystal wall of Heaven, which opening wide,
               Rolled inward, and a spacious Gap disclosed
               Into the wistful Deep; the monstrous sight
               Struck them with horror backward, but far worse
               Urged them behind; headlong themselves they threw
               Down from the verge of Heaven, Eternal wrath
               Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
            
            
               Hell heard th'unsufferable noise, Hell saw
               Heaven ruining from Heaven and would have fled
               Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
               Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
               Nine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared,
               And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
               Through his wilde Anarchy, so huge a rout
               Encumbered him with ruin: Hell at last
               Yawning received them whole, and on them closed,
               Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
               Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
               Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired
               Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
               Sole Victor from th'expulsion of his Foes
               
                  Messiah his triumphal Chariot turned:
               To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
               Eye witnesses of his Almighty Acts,
               
               With Jubilee advanced; and as they went,
               Shaded with branching Palm, each order bright,
               Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,
               Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion given,
               Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode
               Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the Courts
               And Temple of his mighty Father Throned
               On high: who into Glory him received,
               Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
            
            
               Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth
               At thy request, and that thou may beware
               By what is past, to thee I have revealed
               What might have else to human Race bin hid;
               The discord which befell, and War in Heaven
               Among the Angelic Powers, and the deep fall
               Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled
               With Satan, he who envies now thy state,
               Who now is plotting how he may seduce
               Thee also from obedience, that with him
               Bereaved of happiness thou may partake
               His punishment, Eternal misery;
               Which would be all his solace and revenge,
               As a despite don against the most High,
               Thee once to gain Companion of his woe.
               But list'n not to his Temptations, warn
               Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard
               By terrible Example the reward
               Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
               Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
               The End of the Sixth Book.
            
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. BOOK VII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
               Raphael at the request of Adam relates how and
wherefore  this  world was first created; that God, after the 
expelling  of 
Satan and his Angels out of Heaven, declar'd his 
pleasure  to  create  another World and other Creatures to  dwell 
therein;  sends his Son with Glory and attendance of Angels to perform 
the  work  of Creation in six days: the Angels celebrate  with  Hymns 
the performance thereof, and his resignation into Heaven.
            
 This also thy request with
caution asked
               Obtain: though to recount Almighty works
               What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
               Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
               Yet what thou can attain, which best may serve
               To glorify the Maker, and infer
               Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
               Thy hearing, such Commission from above
               I have received, to answer thy desire
               Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain
               To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope
               Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
               Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in Night,
               To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
               Enough is left besides to search and know.
               But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
               Her Temperance over Appetite, to know
               In measure what the mind may well contain,
               Oppresses else with Surfeit, and soon turns
               Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Wind.
            
            
               Know then, that after Lucifer from Heaven
               (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host
               Of Angels, then that Star the Stars among)
               Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep
               Into his place, and the great Son returned
               Victorious with his Saints, The Omnipotent
               Eternal Father from his Throne beheld
               Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.

               
            
            
               So spake the almighty, and to what he spake
               His Word, the filial Godhood, gave effect.
               Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift
               Then time or motion, but to human ears
               Cannot without process of speech be told,
                  
               
               So told as earthly notion can receive.
               Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
               When such was heard declared the Almightie's will;
               Glory they sung to the most High, good will
               To future men, and in their dwellings peace:
               Glory to him whose just avenging ire
               Had driven out th'ungodly from his sight
               And th'habitations of the just; to him
               Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
               Good out of evil to create, in stead
               Of Spirits malign a better Race to bring
               Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
               His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.
               So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son
               On his great Expedition now appeared,
               Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crowned
               Of Majesty Divine, Sapience and Love
               Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
               About his Chariot numberless were poured
               Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,
               And Virtues, winged Spirits, and Chariots winged,
               From the Armoury of God, where stand of old
               Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodged
               Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
               Celestial Equipage; and now came forth
               Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
               Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide
               Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound
               On golden Hinges moving, to let forth
               The King of Glory in his powerful Word
               And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.
               On heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore
               They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss
               Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,
               
               Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
               And surging waves, as Mountains to assault
               Heavens height, and with the Center mix the Pole.
 Said then th'Omnific Word,
 Nor staid, but on the Wings of
Cherubim
               Uplifted, in Paternal Glory rode
               Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;
               For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Train
               Followed in bright procession to behold
               Creation, and the wonders of his might.
               Then staid the fervid Wheels, and in his hand
               He took the golden Compasses, prepared
               In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe
               This Universe, and all created things:
               One foot he centred, and the other turned
               Round through the vast profundity obscure,
               And said, 
 Thus God the Heaven created, thus
the Earth,
               Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound
               Covered th'Abyss: but on the watery calm
               His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
               And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
               Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purged
               The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs
               Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd
               Like things to like, the rest to several place
               Disported, and between spun out the Air,
               And Earth self balanced on her Center hung.
 said God,
and  forthwith Light
               Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure
               Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East
               To journey through the airy gloom began,
                  
               
               Sphered in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun
               Was not; she in a cloudy Tabernacle
               Sojourned the while.  God saw the Light was good;
               And light from darkness by the Hemisphere
               Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night
               He named.  Thus was the first Day Even and Morn:
               Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
               By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light
               Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;
               Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
               The hollow Universal Orb they filled,
               And touched their Golden Harps, and hymning praised
               God and his works, Creator him they sung,
               Both when first Evening was, and when first Morn.
            
            
               Again, God said, 
 and
God made
               The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
               Transparent, Elemental Air, diffused
               In circuit to the uttermost convex
               Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,
               The Waters underneath from those above
               Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World
               Built on circumfluous Waters calm, in wide
               Crystalline Ocean, and the loud misrule
               Of Chaos far removed, least fierce extremes
               Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
               And Heaven he named the Firmament: So Even
               And Morning Chorus sung the second Day.
            
            
               The Earth was formed, but in the Womb as yet
               Of Waters, Embryon immature involved,
               Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
               Main Ocean flowed, not idle, but with warm
               Prolific humour softening all her Globe,
               
               Fermented the great Mother to conceive,
               Satiate with genial moisture, when God said
               
                  
 Immediately the Mountains huge
appear
               Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
               Into the Clouds, their tops ascend the Sky:
               So high as heaved the tumid Hills, so low
               Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
               Capacious bed of Waters: thither they
               Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld
               As drops on dust conglobing from the dry;
               Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,
               For haste; such flight the great command impressed
               On the swift floods: as Armies at the call
               Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou has heard)
               Troop to their Standard, so the watery throng,
               Wave rolling after Wave, where way they found,
               If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plain,
               Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,
               But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
               With Serpent error wandering, found their way,
               And on the wash Ooze deep Channels wore;
               Easy, ever God had bid the ground be dry,
               All but within those banks, where Rivers now
               Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
               The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle
               Of congregated Waters he called Seas:
               And saw that it was good, and said,
 He scarce had said, when the bare
Earth, till then
               Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,
                  
               
               Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad
               Her Universal Face with pleasant green,
               Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden floured
               Opening their various colours, and made gay
               Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,
               Forth flourished thick the clustering Vine, forth crept
               The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed
               Embattled in her field: and the humble Shrub,
               And Bush with frizzled hair implicit: last
               Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spread
               Their branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd
               Their blossoms: with high woods the hills were crowned,
               With tufts the valleys and each fountain side,
               With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now
               Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,
               Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
               Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained
               Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
               None was, but from the Earth a dewy Mist
               Went up and watered all the ground, and each
               Plant of the field, which ever it was in the Earth
               God made, and every Herb, before it grew
               On the green stem; God saw that it was good.
               So Even and Morn recorded the Third Day.
            
            
               Again the almighty spake: 
 and
it was so.
               And God made two great Lights, great for their use
               To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,
               The less by Night alterne: and made the Stars,
               
               And set them in the Firmament of Heaven
               To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day
               In their vicissitude, and rule the Night,
               And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,
               Surveying his great Work, that it was good:
               For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun
               A mighty Sphere he framed, unlightsom first,
               Though of Ethereal Mould: then formed the Moon
               Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,
               And sowed with Stars the Heaven thick as a field:
               Of Light by far the greater part he took,
               Transplanted from her cloudy Shrine, and placed
               In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive
               And drink the liquid Light, firm to retain
               Her gathered beams, great Palace now of Light.
               Hither as to their Fountain other Stars
               Repairing, in their golden Urns draw Light,
               And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns;
               By tincture or reflection they augment
               Their small peculiar, though from human sight
               So far remote, with diminution seen.
               First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,
               Regent of Day, and all the Horizon round
               Invested with bright Rays, jocund to run
               His Longitude through Heavens high rode: the gray
               Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced
               Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,
               But opposite in leveled West was set
               His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light
               From him, for other light she needed none
               In that aspect, and still that distance keeps
               Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,
               Revolved on Heavens great Axle, and her Reign
               With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,
               
               With thousand thousand Stars, that then appeared
               Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adorned
               With their bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,
               Glad Evening and glad Morn crowned the fourth day.
            
            
               And God said, 
 And God created the great Whales,
and each
               Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
               The waters generated by their kinds,
               And every Bird of wing after his kind;
               And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying,
               
                  
 Forthwith the Sounds and Seas,
each Creek and Bay
               With Fry innumerable swarm, and Shoals
               Of Fish that with their Finns and shining Scales
               Glide under the green Wave, in Sculls that oft
               Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate
               Graze the Sea weed their pasture, and through Groves
               Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance
               Show to the Sun their waved coats dropped with Gold,
               Or in their Pearlie shells at ease, attend
               Moist nutriment, or under Rocks their food
               In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seal,
               And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk
               Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their Gate
               Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan
               Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep
               Stretched like a Promontory sleeps or swims,
               And seems a moving Land, and at his Gills
               Draws in, and at his Trunk spouts out a Sea.
               
               Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shores
               Their Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon
               Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
               Their callow young, but feathered soon and fledge
               They summed their Pens, and soaring the air sublime
               With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
               In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork
               On Cliffs and Cedar tops their Eyries build:
               Part loosely wing the Region, part more wise
               In common, ranged in figure wedge their way,
               Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
               Their Aerie Caravan high over Sea's
               Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing
               Easing their flight; so steers the prudent Crane
               Her annual Voyage, born on Winds; the Air
               Floats, as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
               From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song
               Solaced the Woods, and spread their painted wings
               Till Even, nor then the solemn Nightingale
               Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays:
               Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bathed
               Their downy Breast; the Swan with Arched neck
               Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rows
               Her state with Oar feet: yet oft they quit
               The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, tower
               The mid Aerial Sky: Others on ground
               Walked firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds
               The silent hours, and the other whose gay Train
               Adorns him, coloured with the Florid hue
               Of Rainbows and Starry Eyes.  The Waters thus
               With Fish replenished, and the Air with Foul,
               Evening and Morn solemnised the Fifth day.
            
            
               The Sixth, and of Creation last arose
               With Evening Harps and Mitten, when God said,
               
               
                  
 The Earth
obeyed, and strait
               Opening her fertile Womb teemed at a Birth
               numerous living Creatures, perfect forms,
               Limbed and full grown: out of the ground up rose
               As from his Lair the wilde Beast where he one
               In Forest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;
               Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walked:
               The Cattle in the Fields and Meadows green:
               Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
               Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung.
               The grassy Clods now Calv'd, now half appeared
               The Tawny Lion, pawing to get free
               His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,
               And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,
               The Leopard, and the Tiger, as the Moil
               Rising, the crumbled Earth above them threw
               In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground
               Bore up his branching head: scarce from his mould
               
                  Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd
               His vastness: Fleeced the Flocks and bleating rose,
               As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land
               The River Horse and scaly Crocodile.
               At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
               Insect or Worm; those waved their limber fans
               For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact
               In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride
               With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:
               These as a line their long dimension drew,
               Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
               Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kind
               Wondrous in length and corpulence involved
               Their Snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept
               
               The Parsimonious Emmet, provident
               Of future, in small room large heart enclosed,
               Pattern of just equality perhaps
               Hereafter, joined in her popular Tribes
               Of Commonalty: swarming next appeared
               The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone
               Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells
               With Honey stored: the rest are numberless,
               And thou their Natures know, &amp; gave them Names,
               Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
               The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,
               Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen Eyes
               And hairy Main terrific, though to thee
               Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
               Now Heaven in all her Glory shone, and rolled
               Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand
               First wheeled their course; Earth in her rich attire
               Consummate lovely smiled; Air, Water, Earth,
               By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walked
               Frequent; and of the Sixth day yet remained;
               There wanted yet the Master work, the end
               Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone
               And Brute as other Creatures, but endued
               With Sanctity of Reason, might erect
               His Stature, and upright with Front serene
               Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence
               Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
               But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
               Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes
               Directed in Devotion, to adore
               And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
               Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent
               Eternal Father (For where is not he
               Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.
               
               
                  

 This said, he formed thee, Adam,
thee O Man
               Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
               The breath of Life; in his own Image he
               Created thee, in the Image of God
               Express, and thou became a living Soul.
               Male he created thee, but thy consort
               Female for Race; then blessed Mankind, and said,
               
                  
 Wherever thus created, for no
place
               Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know
               He brought thee into this delicious Grove,
               This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,
               Delectable both to behold and taste;
               And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
               Gave thee, all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
               Variety without end; but of the Tree
               Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,
               Thou may not; in the day thou eats, thou did;
               Death is the penalty imposed, beware,
               And govern well thy appetite, least sin
               Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
               Here finished he, and all that he had made
               Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
               So Even and Morn accomplished the Sixth day:
               Yet not till the Creator from his work
               Desisting, though unwearied, up returned
               
               Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode,
               Thence to behold this new created World
               Th'addition of his Empire, how it showed
               In prospect from his Throne, how good, how fair,
               Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode
               Followed with acclamation and the sound
               Symphonious of ten thousand Harps that tuned
               Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Air
               Resounded, (thou remember, for thou heard)
               The Heavens and all the Constellations rung,
               The Planets in their station listening stood,
               While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.
               
                  

 they  sung,
               
                  
 So
sung
               The glorious Train ascending: He through Heaven,
               That opened wide her blazing Portals, led
               To Gods Eternal house direct the way,
               A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold
               And pavement Stars, as Stars to thee appear,
               Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky way
               Which nightly as a circling Zone thou see
               Pouderd with Stars.  And now on Earth the Seventh
               Evening arose in Eden, for the Sun
               Was set, and twilight from the East came on,
               Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount
               Of Heavens high-seated top, the empyreal Throne
               Of Godhood, fixed for ever firm and sure,
               
               The Filial Power arrived, and sate him down
               With his great Father (for he also went
               Invisible, yet staid (such privilege
               Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,
               Author and end of all things, and from work
               Now resting, blessed and hallowed the Seventh day,
               As resting on that day from all his work,
               But not in silence holy kept; the Harp
               Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,
               And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,
               All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire
               Tempered soft Tunings, intermixed with Voice
               Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds
               Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.
               Creation and the Six days acts they sung,
               
                  
 So sung they, and the Empyrean
rung,
               With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept.
               And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked
               How first this World and face of things began,
               And what before thy memory was don
               From the beginning, that posterity
               Informed by thee might know; if else thou seeks
               Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
               The End of the Seventh Book.
            
         
         
         
         
            Paradise Lost. BOOK VIII.
            THE ARGUMENT.
            
               Adam enquires concerning celestial Motions, is doubtfully
 answered, and exhorted to search rather things more worthy of 
knowledge: Adam assents, and still desirous to detain Raphael,
 relates to him what he remembered since his own Creation, his  placing
in Paradise, his talk with God  concerning solitude and
fit society, his first meeting and  Nuptials with Eve, his
discourse with the Angel thereupon; who  after admonitions repeated
departs.
            

               
            
            
               To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heaven
               Is as the Book of God before thee set,
               Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learn
               His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Years:
               This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,
               Imports not, if thou reckon right, the rest
               From Man or Angel the great Architect
               Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
               His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
               Rather admire; or if they list to try
               Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heavens
               
               Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move
               His laughter at their quaint Opinions wide
               Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven
               And calculate the Stars, how they will wield
               The mighty frame, how build, unbuild, contrive
               To save appearances, how gird the Sphere
               With Centres and Eccentric scribbled o'er,
               Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:
               Already by thy reasoning this I guess,
               Who art to lead thy offspring, and suppose
               That bodies bright and greater should not serve
               The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,
               Earth sitting still, when she alone receives
               The benefit: consider first, that Great
               Or Bright infers not Excellence: the Earth
               Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,
               Nor glistening, may of solid good contain
               More plenty then the Sun that barren shines
               Whose virtue on it self works no effect,
               But in the fruitful Earth; there first received
               His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
               Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries
               Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.
               And for the Heavens wide Circuit, let it speak
               The Makers high magnificence, who built
               So spacious, and his Line stretched out so far;
               That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
               An Edifice too large for him to fill,
               Lodged in a small partition, and the rest
               Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
               The swiftness of those Circles attribute
               Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
               That to corporeal substances could add
               Speed almost Spiritual; me thou think not slow,
                  
               
               Who since the Morning hour set out from Heaven
               Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived
               In Eden, distance inexpressible
               By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
               Admitting Motion in the Heavens, to show
               Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;
               Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
               To thee who has thy dwelling here on Earth.
               God to remove his ways from human sense,
               Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,
               If it presume, might err in things too high,
               And no advantage gain.  What if the Sun
               Be Center to the World, and other Stars
               By his attractive virtue and their own
               Incited, dance about him various rounds?
               Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,
               Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
               In six thou see, and what if seventh to these
               The Planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,
               Insensibly three different Motions move?
               Which else to several Spears thou must ascribe,
               Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,
               Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift
               Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb supposed,
               Invisible else above all Stars, the Wheel
               Of Day and Night; which needs not thy belief,
               If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day
               Travelling East, and with her part averse
               From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part
               Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light
               Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,
               To the terrestrial Moon be as a Star
               Enlightening her by Day, as she by Night
               This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,
               
               Fields and Inhabitants: Her spots thou see
               As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce
               Fruits in her softened Soil, for some to eat
               Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps
               With their attendant Moons thou wilt descry
               Communicating Male and Female Light,
               Which two great Sexes animate the World,
               Stored in each Orb perhaps with some that live.
               For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
               By living Soul, desert and desolate,
               Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute
               Each Orb a glimpse of Light, conveyed so far
               Down to this habitable, which returns
               Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
               But whether thus these things, or whether not,
               Whether the Sun predominant in Heaven
               Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun
               He from the East his flaming rode begin,
               Or She from West her silent course advance
               With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
               On her soft Axle, while she paces Even,
               And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,
               Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,
               Leave them to God above, him serve and fear;
               Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,
               Wherever placed, let him dispose: joy thou
               In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
               
               And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high
               To know what passes there; be lowly wise:.
               Think only what concerns thee and thy being;
               Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there
               Live, in what state, condition or degree,
               Contented that thus far hath been revealed
               Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven.
                  
                  

               
            
            
               Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
               Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
               Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
               Inward and outward both, his image fair:
               Speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
               Attends thee, and each word, each motion forms,
               Nor less think wee in Heaven of thee on Earth
               Then of our fellow servant, and inquire
               Gladly into the ways of God with Man:
               For God we see hath honoured thee, and set
               On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on;
               For I that Day was absent, as befell,
               Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
               Far on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;
               Squared in full Legion (such command we had)
               To see that none thence issued forth a spy,
               Or enemy, while God was in his work,
               Least he incensed at such eruption bold,
               Destruction with Creation might have mixed.
               Not that they dared without his leave attempt,
               But us he sends upon his high behests
               For state, as Soverign King, and to enure
               Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut
               The dismal Gates, and barricaded strong;
               But long ere our approaching heard within
               Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,
               Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
               Glad we returned up to the coasts of Light
               Ere Sabbath Evening: so we had in charge.
               
               But thy relation now; for I attend,
               Pleased with thy words no less then thou with mine.

               
            
            
               Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;
               Do thou but thine, and be not diffident
               Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou
               Dismiss not her, when most thou need her nigh,
               By attributing overmuch to things
               Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.
               For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,
               An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well
               Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,
               Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;
               Then value: Oft times nothing profits more
               Then self esteem, grounded on just and right
               Well managed; of that skill the more thou know,
               The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,
               And to realities yield all her shows:
               Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
               So awful, that with honour thou may love
               Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
               But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
               Is propagated seem such dear delight
               Beyond all other, think the same Vouchsafed
               To Cattle and each Beast; which would not be
               To them made common and divulged, if aught
               Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
               The Soul of Man, or passion in him move.
               What higher in her society thou finds
                  
               
               Attractive, human, rational, love still;
               In loving thou does well, in passion not,
               Wherein true Love consists not; love refines
               The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat
               In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale
               By which to heavenly Love thou may ascend,
               Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause
               Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.
 Let it suffice thee
that thou know
               
               Us happy, and without Love no happiness.
               Whatever pure thou in the body enjoys
               (And pure thou were created) we enjoy
               In eminence, and obstacle find none
               Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars:
               Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace,
               Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure
               Desiring; nor restrained conveyance need
               As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.
               But I can now no more; the parting Sun
               Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
               
                  Hesperian sets, my Signal to depart.
               Be strong, live happy, and love, but first of all
               Him whom to love is to obey, and keep
               His great command; take heed least Passion sway
               Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will
               Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons
               The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware.
               I in thy persevering shall rejoice,
               And all the Blessed: stand fast; to stand or fall
               Free in thine own Arbitrament it lies.
               Perfect within, no outward aid require;
               And all temptation to transgress repel.
