 I know thee, stranger,
who thou art,
               That mighty leading Angel, who of late
               Made head against Heavens King, though overthrown.
               I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host
               Fled not in silence through the frighted deep
               With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
               Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven Gates
               Poured out by millions her victorious Bands
               Pursuing.  I upon my Frontiers here
               Keep residence; if all I can will serve,
               That little which is left so to defend,
               Encroached on still through our intestine broils
               Weakening the Sceptre of old Night: first Hell
               Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;
               Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World
               Hung ore my Realm, linked in a golden Chain
               To that side Heaven from whence your Legions fell:
               If that way be your walk, you have not far;
               So much the nearer danger; go and speed;
               Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain.
